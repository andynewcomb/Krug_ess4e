<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p169"><p>We have now covered the first three key elements in the supply and demand model: the demand curve, the supply curve, and the set of factors that shift each curve. The next step is to put these elements together to show how they can be used to predict the actual price at which the good is bought and sold, as well as the actual quantity transacted.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p170"><p>What determines the price at which a good or service is bought and sold? What determines the quantity transacted of the good or service? In <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch1_1.html">Chapter 1</span> we learned the general principle that <em>markets move toward equilibrium</em>, a situation in which no individual would be better off taking a different action. In the case of a competitive market, we can be more specific: a competitive market is in equilibrium when the price has moved to a level at which the quantity of a good demanded equals the quantity of that good supplied. At that price, no individual seller could make herself better off by offering to sell either more or less of the good and no individual buyer could make himself better off by offering to buy more or less of the good. In other words, at the market equilibrium, price has moved to a level that exactly matches the quantity demanded by consumers to the quantity supplied by sellers.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p173"><p>The easiest way to determine the equilibrium price and quantity in a market is by putting the supply curve and the demand curve on the same diagram. Since the supply curve shows the quantity supplied at any given price and the demand curve shows the quantity demanded at any given price, the price at which the two curves cross is the equilibrium price: the price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p175"><p>Let’s confirm that point <em>E</em> fits our definition of equilibrium. At a price of $3 per BTU, natural gas producers are willing to sell 10 trillion BTUs a year and natural gas consumers want to buy 10 trillion BTUs a year. So at the price of $3 per BTU, the quantity of natural gas supplied equals the quantity demanded. Notice that at any other price the market would not clear: every willing buyer would not be able to find a willing seller, or vice versa. More specifically, if the price were more than $3, the quantity supplied would exceed the quantity demanded; if the price were less than $3, the quantity demanded would exceed the quantity supplied.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p177"><p>We have been talking about the price at which a good or service is bought <em>and</em> sold, as if the two were the same. But shouldn’t we make a distinction between the price received by sellers and the price paid by buyers? In principle, yes; but it is helpful at this point to sacrifice a bit of realism in the interest of simplicity—by assuming away the difference between the prices received by sellers and those paid by buyers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p178"><p>In reality, there is often a middleman—someone who brings buyers and sellers together. The middleman buys from suppliers, then sells to consumers at a markup. For example, natural gas brokers buy natural gas from drillers, and then sell the natural gas to gas companies who distribute it to households and firms. The drillers generally receive less than the gas companies pay per BTU of gas. But no mystery there: that difference is how natural gas brokers make a living.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p179"><p>In many markets, however, the difference between the buying and selling price is quite small. So it’s not a bad approximation to think of the price paid by buyers as being the <em>same</em> as the price received by sellers. And that is what we assume in this chapter.</p></div>

<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-sec2-8">Why Do All Sales and Purchases in a Market Take Place at the Same Price?
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p184"><p>There are some markets where the same good can sell for many different prices, depending on who is selling or who is buying. For example, have you ever bought a souvenir in a “tourist trap” and then seen the same item on sale somewhere else (perhaps even in the shop next door) for a lower price? Because tourists don’t know which shops offer the best deals and don’t have time for comparison shopping, sellers in tourist areas can charge different prices for the same good.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p185"><p>But in any market where the buyers and sellers have both been around for some time, sales and purchases tend to converge at a generally uniform price, so we can safely talk about <em>the</em> market price. It’s easy to see why. Suppose a seller offered a potential buyer a price noticeably above what the buyer knew other people to be paying. The buyer would clearly be better off shopping elsewhere—unless the seller were prepared to offer a better deal.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_87"><p>87</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p186"><p>Conversely, a seller would not be willing to sell for significantly less than the amount he knew most buyers were paying; he would be better off waiting to get a more reasonable customer. So in any well-established, ongoing market, all sellers receive and all buyers pay approximately the same price. This is what we call the <em>market price.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p190"><p>This surplus means that some natural gas producers are frustrated: at the current price, they cannot find consumers who want to buy their natural gas. The surplus offers an incentive for those frustrated would-be sellers to offer a lower price in order to poach business from other producers and entice more consumers to buy. The result of this price cutting will be to push the prevailing price down until it reaches the equilibrium price.

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p199"><p>Puzzling as this may seem, there is no contradiction once we take opportunity costs and tastes into account. For major events, buying tickets from the box office means waiting in very long lines. Ticket buyers who use online resellers have decided that the opportunity cost of their time is too high to spend waiting in line. And tickets for major events being sold at face value by online box offices often sell out within minutes. In this case, some people who want to go to the concert badly but have missed out on the opportunity to buy cheaper tickets from the online box office are willing to pay the higher online reseller price.</p></div>

You’ll notice that the prices quoted by different sellers for seats close to one another are also very close: $184.99 versus $185 for seats on the main floor of the Drake concert. As the competitive market model predicts, units of the same good end up selling for the same price. And prices move in response to demand and supply.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p201"><p>According to an article in the <em>New York Times,</em> tickets on <span data-type="link" data-href="http://www.StubHub.com">StubHub.com</span> can sell for less than the face value for events with little appeal, but prices can skyrocket for events that are in high demand. (The article quotes a price of $3,530 for a Madonna concert.) Even <span data-type="link" data-href="http://www.StubHub.com">StubHub.com</span>’s chief executive says his site is “the embodiment of supply-and-demand economics.”</p></div>
