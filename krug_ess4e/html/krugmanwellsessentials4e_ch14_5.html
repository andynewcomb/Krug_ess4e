<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p205"><p>The twin goals of reducing inflation and unemployment are the main concerns of macroeconomic policy.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p206"><p><strong>Employment</strong> is the number of people employed; <strong>unemployment</strong> is the number of people unemployed and actively looking for work. Their sum is equal to the <strong>labor force,</strong> and the <strong>labor force participation rate</strong> is the percentage of the population age 16 or older that is in the labor force.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p207"><p>The <strong>unemployment rate,</strong> the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively looking for work, can both overstate and understate the true level of unemployment. It can overstate because it counts as unemployed those who are continuing to search for a job despite having been offered one. It can understate because it ignores frustrated workers, such as <strong>discouraged workers, marginally attached workers,</strong> and the <strong>underemployed.</strong> In addition, the unemployment rate varies greatly among different groups in the population; it is typically higher for younger workers and for workers near retirement age than for workers in their prime working years.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p208"><p>The unemployment rate is affected by the business cycle. The unemployment rate generally falls when the growth rate of real GDP is above average and generally increases when the growth rate of real GDP is below average. A <strong>jobless recovery,</strong> a period in which real GDP is growing but unemployment rises, often follows recessions.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p209"><p>Job creation and destruction, as well as voluntary job separations, lead to <strong>job search</strong> and <strong>frictional unemployment.</strong> In addition, a variety of factors such as minimum wages, unions, <strong>efficiency wages,</strong> government policies designed to help laid-off workers, and mismatch between employees and employers result in a situation in which there is a surplus of labor at the market wage rate, creating <strong>structural unemployment.</strong> As a result, the <strong>natural rate of unemployment,</strong> the sum of frictional and structural unemployment, is well above zero, even when jobs are plentiful.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p210"><p>The actual unemployment rate is equal to the natural rate of unemployment, the share of unemployment that is independent of the business cycle, plus <strong>cyclical unemployment,</strong> the share of unemployment that depends on fluctuations in the business cycle.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p211"><p>The natural rate of unemployment changes over time, largely in response to changes in labor force characteristics, labor market institutions, and government policies.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p212"><p>Inflation does not, as many assume, make everyone poorer by raising the level of prices. Thatâ€™s because wages and incomes are adjusted to take into account a rising price level, leaving <strong>real wages</strong> and <strong>real income</strong> unaffected. However, a high inflation rate imposes overall costs on the economy: <strong>shoe-leather costs, menu costs,</strong> and <strong>unit-of-account costs.</strong></p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p213"><p>Inflation can produce winners and losers within the economy, because long-term contracts are generally written in dollar terms. The <strong>interest rate</strong> specified in a loan is typically a <strong>nominal interest rate,</strong> which differs from the <strong>real interest rate</strong> due to inflation. A higher-than-expected inflation rate is good for borrowers and bad for lenders. A lower-than-expected inflation rate is good for lenders and bad for borrowers.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p214"><p>Many believe policies that depress the economy and produce high unemployment are necessary to reduce embedded inflation. Because <strong>disinflation</strong> is very costly, policy makers try to prevent inflation from becoming excessive in the first place.</p></div>
