</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p180"><p>Why will an increase in the demand for Christmas trees lead to a large price increase at first but a much smaller increase in the long run? The answer lies in the behavior of the <strong>industry supply curve—</strong>the relationship between the price and the total output of an industry as a whole. The industry supply curve is what we referred to in earlier chapters as <em>the</em> supply curve or the market supply curve. But here we take some extra care to distinguish between the <em>individual supply curve</em> of a single firm and the supply curve of the industry as a whole.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p181"><p>As you might guess from the previous section, the industry supply curve must be analyzed in somewhat different ways for the short run and the long run. Let’s start with the short run.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p182"><p>Recall that in the short run the number of producers in an industry is fixed—there is no entry or exit. And you may also remember from <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch3_1.html">Chapter 3</span> that the market supply curve is the horizontal sum of the individual supply curves of all producers—you find it by summing the total output across all suppliers at every given price. We will do that exercise here under the assumption that all the producers are alike—an assumption that makes the derivation particularly simple. So let’s assume that there are 100 Christmas tree farms, each with the same costs as Noelle’s farm.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p184"><p>Each of these 100 farms will have an individual short-run supply curve like the one in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_04.html">Figure 7-4</span>. At a price below $10, no farms will produce. At a price of $10 or more, each farm will produce the quantity of output at which its marginal cost is equal to the market price. As you can see from <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_04.html">Figure 7-4</span>, this will lead each farm to produce 40 trees if the price is $14 per tree, 50 trees if the price is $18, and so on. So if there are 100 tree farms and the price of Christmas trees is $18 per tree, the industry as a whole will produce 5,000 trees, corresponding to 100 farms × 50 trees per farm, and so on. The result is the <strong>short-run industry supply curve,</strong> shown as <em>S</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_05.html">Figure 7-5</span>.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p189"><p>What will happen as additional producers enter the industry? Clearly, the quantity supplied at any given price will increase. The short-run industry supply curve will shift to the right. This will, in turn, alter the market equilibrium and result in a lower market price.

<span data-type="number">Figure 7.6: </span><span data-type="caption">Point <em>E<sub>MKT</sub></em> of panel (a) shows the initial short-run market equilibrium. Each of the 100 existing producers makes an economic profit, illustrated in panel (b) by the green rectangle labeled <em>A,</em> the profit of an existing firm. Profits induce entry by additional producers, shifting the short-run industry supply curve outward from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>S</em><sub>2</sub> in panel (a), resulting in a new short-run equilibrium at point <em>D<sub>MKT</sub>,</em> at a lower market price of $16 and higher industry output. Existing firms reduce output and profit falls to the area given by the striped rectangle labeled <em>B</em> in panel (b).

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p191"><p>These profits will induce new producers to enter the industry, shifting the short-run industry supply curve to the right.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p193"><p>Although diminished, the profit of existing firms at <em>D<sub>MKT</sub></em> means that entry will continue and the number of firms will continue to rise.

At this price there is no incentive either for potential producers to enter or for existing producers to exit the industry. So <em>C<sub>MKT</sub></em> corresponds to a <strong>long-run market equilibrium—</strong>a situation in which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded given that sufficient time has elapsed for producers to either enter or exit the industry.

<span data-type="number">Figure 7.7: </span><span data-type="caption">Panel (b) shows how an industry adjusts in the short and long run to an increase in demand; panels (a) and (c) show the corresponding adjustments by an existing firm. Initially the market is at point <em>X<sub>MKT</sub></em> in panel (b), a short-run and long-run equilibrium at a price of $14 and industry output of <em>Q<sub>X</sub></em>. An existing firm makes zero economic profit, operating at point <em>X</em> in panel (a) at minimum average total cost. Demand increases as <em>D</em><sub>1</sub> shifts rightward to <em>D</em><sub>2</sub> in panel (b), raising the market price to $18. Existing firms increase their output, and industry output moves along the short-run industry supply curve <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> to a short-run equilibrium at <em>Y<sub>MKT</sub>.</em> Correspondingly, the existing firm in panel (a) moves from point <em>X</em> to point <em>Y.</em> But at a price of $18 existing firms are profitable. As shown in panel (b), in the long run new entrants arrive and the short-run industry supply curve shifts rightward, from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>. There is a new equilibrium at point <em>Z<sub>MKT</sub>,</em> at a lower price of $14 and higher industry output of <em>Q<sub>Z</sub></em>. An existing firm responds by moving from <em>Y</em> to <em>Z</em> in panel (c), returning to its initial output level and zero economic profit. Production by new entrants accounts for the total increase in industry output, <em>Q<sub>Z</sub></em> − <em>Q<sub>X</sub></em>. Like <em>X<sub>MKT</sub>, Z<sub>MKT</sub></em> is also a short-run and long-run equilibrium: with existing firms earning zero economic profit, there is no incentive for any firms to enter or exit the industry. The horizontal line passing through <em>X<sub>MKT</sub></em> and <em>Z<sub>MKT</sub>, LRS,</em> is the long-run industry supply curve: at the break-even price of $14, producers will produce any amount that consumers demand in the long run.</span>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p196"><p>In panel (b) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_07.html">Figure 7-7</span>, <em>D</em><sub>1</sub> is the initial demand curve and <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> is the initial short-run industry supply curve. Their intersection at point <em>X<sub>MKT</sub></em> is both a short-run and a long-run market equilibrium because the equilibrium price of $14 leads to zero economic profit—and therefore neither entry nor exit. It corresponds to point <em>X</em> in panel (a), where an individual existing firm is operating at the minimum of its average total cost curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p197"><p>Now suppose that the demand curve shifts out for some reason to <em>D</em><sub>2</sub>. As shown in panel (b), in the short run, industry output moves along the short-run industry supply curve <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> to the new short-run market equilibrium at <em>Y<sub>MKT</sub>,</em> the intersection of <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>D</em><sub>2</sub>. The market price rises to $18 per tree, and industry output increases from <em>Q<sub>X</sub></em> to <em>Q<sub>Y</sub>.</em> This corresponds to an existing firm’s movement from <em>X</em> to <em>Y</em> in panel (a) as the firm increases its output in response to the rise in the market price.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p198"><p>But we know that <em>Y<sub>MKT</sub></em> is not a long-run equilibrium, because $18 is higher than minimum average total cost, so existing producers are making economic profits.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p199"><p>Over time entry will cause the short-run industry supply curve to shift to the right. In the long run, the short-run industry supply curve will have shifted out to <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>, and the equilibrium will be at <em>Z<sub>MKT</sub></em>—with the price falling back to $14 per tree and industry output increasing yet again, from <em>Q<sub>Y</sub></em> to <em>Q<sub>Z</sub>.</em> Like <em>X<sub>MKT</sub></em> before the increase in demand, <em>Z<sub>MKT</sub></em> is both a short-run and a long-run market equilibrium.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p200"><p>The effect of entry on an existing firm is illustrated in panel (c), in the movement from <em>Y</em> to <em>Z</em> along the firm’s individual supply curve. The firm reduces its output in response to the fall in the market price, ultimately arriving back at its original output quantity, corresponding to the minimum of its average total cost curve. In fact, every firm that is now in the industry—the initial set of firms and the new entrants—will operate at the minimum of its average total cost curve, at point <em>Z.</em> This means that the entire increase in industry output, from <em>Q<sub>X</sub></em> to <em>Q<sub>Z</sub>,</em> comes from production by new entrants.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-gl-def" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p201"><p>The <strong>long-run industry supply curve</strong> shows how the quantity supplied responds to the price once producers have had time to enter or exit the industry.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p202"><p>The line <em>LRS</em> that passes through <em>X<sub>MKT</sub></em> and <em>Z<sub>MKT</sub></em> in panel (b) is the <strong>long-run industry supply curve.</strong> It shows how the quantity supplied by an industry responds to the price given that producers have had time to enter or exit the industry.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p203"><p>In this particular case, the long-run industry supply curve is horizontal at $14. In other words, in this industry supply is <em>perfectly elastic</em> in the long run: given time to enter or exit, producers will supply any quantity that consumers demand at a price of $14. Perfectly elastic long-run supply is actually a good assumption for many industries. In this case we speak of there being <em>constant costs across the industry</em>: each firm, regardless of whether it is an incumbent or a new entrant, faces the same cost structure (that is, they each have the same cost curves). Industries that satisfy this condition are industries in which there is a perfectly elastic supply of inputs—industries like agriculture or bakeries.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p204"><p>In other industries, however, even the long-run industry supply curve slopes upward. The usual reason for this is that producers must use some input that is in limited supply (that is, inelastically supplied). As the industry expands, the price of that input is driven up. Consequently, later entrants in the industry find that they have a higher cost structure than early entrants. An example is beachfront resort hotels, which must compete for a limited quantity of prime beachfront property. Industries that behave like this are said to have <em>increasing costs across the industry.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p205"><p>It is possible for the long-run industry supply curve to slope downward. This can occur when an industry faces increasing returns to scale, in which average costs fall as output rises. Notice we said that the <em>industry</em> faces increasing returns. However, when increasing returns apply at the level of the individual firm, the industry usually ends up dominated by a small number of firms (an <em>oligopoly</em>) or a single firm (a <em>monopoly</em>).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p206"><p>In some cases, the advantages of large scale for an entire industry accrue to all firms in that industry. For example, the costs of new technologies such as solar panels tend to fall as the industry grows because that growth leads to improved knowledge, a larger pool of workers with the right skills, and so on.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p207"><p>Regardless of whether the long-run industry supply curve is horizontal or upward sloping or even downward sloping, the long-run price elasticity of supply is <em>higher</em> than the short-run price elasticity whenever there is free entry and exit. As shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_08.html">Figure 7-8</span>, the long-run industry supply curve is always flatter than the short-run industry supply curve. The reason is entry and exit: a high price caused by an increase in demand attracts entry by new producers, resulting in a rise in industry output and an eventual fall in price; a low price caused by a decrease in demand induces existing firms to exit, leading to a fall in industry output and an eventual increase in price.</p></div>

<span data-type="number">Figure 7.8: </span><span data-type="caption">The long-run industry supply curve may slope upward, but it is always flatter—more elastic—than the short-run industry supply curve. This is because of entry and exit: a higher price attracts new entrants in the long run, resulting in a rise in industry output and a fall in price; a lower price induces existing producers to exit in the long run, generating a fall in industry output and an eventual rise in price.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p208"><p>The distinction between the short-run industry supply curve and the long-run industry supply curve is very important in practice. We often see a sequence of events like that shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_07.html">Figure 7-7</span>: an increase in demand initially leads to a large price increase, but prices return to their initial level once new firms have entered the industry. Or we see the sequence in reverse: a fall in demand reduces prices in the short run, but they return to their initial level as producers exit the industry.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-t" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p209a"><p><strong>ECONOMIC PROFIT, AGAIN</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p209"><p>Some readers may wonder why a firm would want to enter an industry if the market price is only slightly greater than the break-even price. Wouldn’t a firm prefer to go into another business that yields a higher profit?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p210"><p>The answer is that here, as always, when we calculate cost, we mean <em>opportunity cost—</em>that is, cost that includes the return a firm could get by using its resources elsewhere. And so the profit that we calculate is <em>economic profit;</em> if the market price is above the break-even level, no matter how slightly, the firm can earn more in this industry than they could elsewhere.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p211"><p>Our analysis leads us to three conclusions about the cost of production and efficiency in the long-run equilibrium of a perfectly competitive industry. These results will be important in our discussion in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch8_1.html">Chapter 8</span> of how monopoly gives rise to inefficiency.</p></div>
<ol data-block_type="numbered" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-list-10">
<li><div data-block_type="nl-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p212"><p>In a perfectly competitive industry in equilibrium, the value of marginal cost is the same for all firms. That’s because all firms produce the quantity of output at which marginal cost equals the market price, and as price-takers they all face the same market price.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-mid" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p213"><p>In a perfectly competitive industry with free entry and exit, each firm will have zero economic profit in long-run equilibrium. Each firm produces the quantity of output that minimizes its average total cost—corresponding to point <em>Z</em> in panel (c) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_07.html">Figure 7-7</span>. So the total cost of production of the industry’s output is minimized in a perfectly competitive industry.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="nl-mid" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p214"><p>The exception is an industry with increasing costs across the industry. Given a sufficiently high market price, early entrants make positive economic profits, but the last entrants do not as the market price falls. Costs are minimized for later entrants, as the industry reaches long-run equilibrium, but not necessarily for the early ones.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-last" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p215"><p>The long-run market equilibrium of a perfectly competitive industry is efficient: no mutually beneficial transactions go unexploited. To understand this, recall a fundamental requirement for efficiency: all consumers who have a willingness to pay greater than or equal to sellers’ costs actually get the good. We also learned that when a market is efficient (except under certain, well-defined conditions), the market price matches all consumers with a willingness to pay greater than or equal to the market price to all sellers who have a cost of producing the good less than or equal to the market price.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p216"><p>So in the long-run equilibrium of a perfectly competitive industry, production is efficient: costs are minimized and no resources are wasted. In addition, the allocation of goods to consumers is efficient: every consumer willing to pay the cost of producing a unit of the good gets it. Indeed, no mutually beneficial transaction is left unexploited. Moreover, this condition tends to persist over time as the environment changes: the force of competition makes producers responsive to changes in consumers’ desires and to changes in technology.</p></div>

Why? Because that is when the global wine market went from glut to shortage. This was a big change from the years 2004 to 2010, when the wine industry battled with an oversupply of product and plunging prices, driven first by a series of large global harvests and then by declining demand due to the global recession of 2008. After years of losses, many wine producers finally decided to exit the industry.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p220"><p>By 2012, wine production capacity was down significantly in Europe, South America, Africa, and Australia, and inventories were at their lowest point in over a decade. Moreover, 2012 was a year of bad weather for wine producers. And that same year, American wine consumption started growing again, while China’s wine consumption was surging, quadrupling over the previous five years. So combine a significant drop in capacity, a weather-induced fall in supply, and an increase in demand and—<em>voilà!</em>—a wine shortage appears.</p></div>

The lack of production in other parts of the world and surging demand in China have opened opportunities for expansion. As the CEO of Washington State’s Chateau Ste.
