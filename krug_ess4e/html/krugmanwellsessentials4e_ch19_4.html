</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p126"><p>In 1993 Stanford economist John Taylor suggested that monetary policy should follow a simple rule that takes into account concerns about both the business cycle and inflation. He also suggested that actual monetary policy often looks as if the Federal Reserve was, in fact, more or less following the proposed rule. A <strong>Taylor rule for monetary policy</strong> is a rule for setting interest rates that takes into account the inflation rate and the output gap or, in some cases, the unemployment rate.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p127"><p>A widely cited example of a Taylor rule is a relationship among Fed policy, inflation, and unemployment estimated by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p132"><p>Until January 2012, the Fed did not explicitly commit itself to achieving a particular inflation rate. However, in January 2012, the Fed announced that it would set its policy to maintain an approximately 2% inflation rate per year. With that statement, the Fed joined a number of other central banks that have explicit inflation targets. So rather than using a Taylor rule to set monetary policy, they instead announce the inflation rate that they want to achieve—the <em>inflation target—</em>and set policy in an attempt to hit that target. This method of setting monetary policy, called <strong>inflation targeting,</strong> involves having the central bank announce the inflation rate it is trying to achieve and set policy in an attempt to hit that target. The central bank of New Zealand, which was the first country to adopt inflation targeting, specified a range for that target of 1% to 3%.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_555"><p>555</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p133"><p>Other central banks commit themselves to achieving a specific number. For example, the Bank of England has committed to keeping inflation at 2%. In practice, there doesn’t seem to be much difference between these versions: central banks with a target range for inflation seem to aim for the middle of that range, and central banks with a fixed target tend to give themselves considerable wiggle room.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p134"><p>One major difference between inflation targeting and the Taylor rule method is that inflation targeting is forward-looking rather than backward-looking. That is, the Taylor rule method adjusts monetary policy in response to <em>past</em> inflation, but inflation targeting is based on a forecast of future inflation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p135"><p>Advocates of inflation targeting argue that it has two key advantages over a Taylor rule: <em>transparency</em> and <em>accountability.</em> First, economic uncertainty is reduced because the central bank’s plan is transparent: the public knows the objective of an inflation-targeting central bank. Second, the central bank’s success can be judged by seeing how closely actual inflation rates have matched the inflation target, making central bankers accountable.</p></div>

The central banks of Britain and Norway have specific targets for inflation, 2% and 2.5%, respectively. Neither states by how much they’re prepared to miss those targets.

<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p138"><p>In practice, these differences in detail don’t seem to lead to any significant difference in results.

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p139"><p>Critics of inflation targeting argue that it’s too restrictive because there are times when other concerns—like the stability of the financial system—should take priority over achieving any particular inflation rate. Indeed, in late 2007 and early 2008 the Fed cut interest rates much more than either a Taylor rule or inflation targeting would have dictated, fearing that turmoil in the financial markets would lead to a major recession. (In fact, it did.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p140"><p>Many American macroeconomists have had positive things to say about inflation targeting—including Ben Bernanke (the previous chairman of the Fed). And in January 2012 the Fed declared that what it means by the “price stability” it seeks is 2% inflation, although there was no explicit commitment about when this inflation rate would be achieved.</p></div>

After that, however, things go awry, and for a simple reason: with very high unemployment and low inflation, the same Taylor rule called for an interest rate less than zero, which isn’t possible.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p142"><p>Why aren’t negative interest rates possible? Because people always have the alternative of holding cash, which offers a zero interest rate.

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p144"><p>The fact that interest rates can’t go below zero—called the <strong>zero lower bound for interest rates—</strong>sets limits to the power of monetary policy. In 2009 and 2010, inflation was low and the economy was operating far below potential, so the Federal Reserve wanted to increase aggregate demand. Yet the normal way it does this—open-market purchases of short-term government debt to expand the money supply—had run out of room to operate because short-term interest rates were already at or near zero.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p145"><p>In November 2010 the Fed began an attempt to circumvent this problem, through <em>quantitative easing</em>. Instead of purchasing only short-term government debt, it began buying longer-term government debt—five-year or six-year bonds, rather than three-month Treasury bills. As we have already pointed out, long-term interest rates don’t exactly follow short-term rates. At the time the Fed began this program, short-term rates were near zero, but rates on longer-term bonds were between 2% and 3%. The Fed hoped that direct purchases of these longer-term bonds would drive down interest rates on long-term debt, exerting an expansionary effect on the economy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p146"><p>Later the Fed expanded the program to include purchasing mortgage-backed securities, which normally offer somewhat higher rates than U.S. government debt. Here too the hope was that these rates could be driven down, with an expansionary effect on the economy. As with ordinary open-market operations, quantitative easing was undertaken by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p147"><p>Was this policy effective? The Federal Reserve believes that it helped the economy. However, the pace of recovery remained disappointingly slow.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p150"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap"><strong>W</strong></span>hat’s the evidence that the Fed can actually cause an economic contraction or expansion? You might think that finding such evidence is just a matter of looking at what happens to the economy when interest rates go up or down. But it turns out that there’s a big problem with that approach: the Fed usually changes interest rates in an attempt to tame the business cycle, raising rates if the economy is expanding and reducing rates if the economy is slumping. So in the actual data, it often looks as if low interest rates go along with a weak economy and high rates go along with a strong economy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p151"><p>In a famous 1994 paper titled “Monetary Policy Matters,” the macroeconomists Christina Romer and David Romer solved this problem by focusing on episodes in which monetary policy wasn’t a reaction to the business cycle. Specifically, they used minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee and other sources to identify episodes “in which the Federal Reserve in effect decided to attempt to create a recession to reduce inflation.”</p></div>

In four out of the five cases, the decision to contract the economy was followed, after a modest lag, by a rise in the unemployment rate. On average, Romer and Romer found, the unemployment rate rises by 2 percentage points after the Fed decides that unemployment needs to go up.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="sr1-bl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p154"><p>The Federal Reserve can use <strong>expansionary monetary policy</strong> to increase aggregate demand and <strong>contractionary monetary policy</strong> to reduce aggregate demand. The Federal Reserve and other central banks generally try to tame the business cycle while keeping the inflation rate low but positive.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sr1-bl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p155"><p>Under a <strong>Taylor rule for monetary policy,</strong> the target federal funds rate rises when there is high inflation and either a positive output gap or very low unemployment; it falls when there is low or negative inflation and either a negative output gap or high unemployment.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sr1-bl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p156"><p>In contrast, some central banks set monetary policy by <strong>inflation targeting,</strong> a forward-looking policy rule, rather than by using the Taylor rule, a backward-looking policy rule. Although inflation targeting has the benefits of transparency and accountability, some think it is too restrictive. Until 2008, the Fed followed a loosely defined Taylor rule. Starting in early 2012, it began inflation targeting with a target of 2% per year.</p></div>
