<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p19"><p>Let’s begin with the obvious: modern governments in economically advanced countries spend a great deal of money and collect a lot in taxes. <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_01.html">Figure 17-1</span> shows government spending and tax revenue as percentages of GDP for a selection of high-income countries in 2014. As you can see, the French government sector is relatively large, accounting for more than half of the French economy. The government of the United States plays a smaller role in the economy than those of Canada or most European countries. But that role is still sizable, with the government playing a major role in the U.S. economy. As a result, changes in the federal budget—changes in government spending or in taxation—can have large effects on the American economy. </p></div>

These include Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as well as smaller programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps. And in 2014, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was implemented. Created to ensure that every American is covered by health insurance, the ACA works through a system of regulated private insurance markets, subsidies, and an expansion of Medicaid eligibility. In the United States, social insurance programs are largely paid for with special, dedicated taxes on wages—the social insurance taxes we mentioned earlier.

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p32"><p>Let’s recall the basic equation of national income accounting:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p33"><p><strong>(17-1)</strong> GDP = <em>C</em> + <em>I</em> + <em>G</em> + <em>X</em> − <em>IM</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p34"><p>The left side of this equation is GDP, the value of all final goods and services produced in the economy. The right side is aggregate spending, total spending on final goods and services produced in the economy. It is the sum of consumer spending (<em>C</em>), investment spending (<em>I</em>), government purchases of goods and services (<em>G</em>), and the value of exports (<em>X</em>) minus the value of imports (<em>IM</em>). It includes all the sources of aggregate demand.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p35"><p>The government directly controls one of the variables on the right side of <span data-type="link" data-href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p33">Equation 17-1</span>: government purchases of goods and services (<em>G</em>). But that’s not the only effect fiscal policy has on aggregate spending in the economy. Through changes in taxes and transfers, it also influences consumer spending (<em>C</em>) and, in some cases, investment spending (<em>I</em>).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch17_page_478"><p>478</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p36"><p>To see why the budget affects consumer spending, recall that <em>disposable income,</em> the total income households have available to spend, is equal to the total income they receive from wages, dividends, interest, and rent, <em>minus</em> taxes, <em>plus</em> government transfers. So either an increase in taxes or a reduction in government transfers <em>reduces</em> disposable income. And a fall in disposable income, other things equal, leads to a fall in consumer spending. Conversely, either a decrease in taxes or an increase in government transfers <em>increases</em> disposable income. And a rise in disposable income, other things equal, leads to a rise in consumer spending.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p37"><p>The government’s ability to affect investment spending is a more complex story, which we won’t discuss in detail. The important point is that the government taxes profits, and changes in the rules that determine how much a business owes can increase or reduce the incentive to spend on investment goods.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p38"><p>Because the government itself is one source of spending in the economy, and because taxes and transfers can affect spending by consumers and firms, the government can use changes in taxes or government spending to <em>shift the aggregate demand curve.</em> And as we saw in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch16_1.html">Chapter 16</span>, there are sometimes good reasons to shift the aggregate demand curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p39"><p>In early 2009, as this chapter’s opening story explained, the Obama administration believed it was crucial that the U.S. government act to increase aggregate demand—that is, to move the aggregate demand curve to the right of where it would otherwise be. The 2009 stimulus package was a classic example of <em>fiscal policy:</em> the use of taxes, government transfers, or government purchases of goods and services to stabilize the economy by shifting the aggregate demand curve.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p58"><p>The first of these claims is wrong in principle, but it has nonetheless played a prominent role in public debates. The second is valid under some, but not all, circumstances. The third argument, although it raises some important issues, isn’t a good reason to believe that expansionary fiscal policy doesn’t work.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p59"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Claim 1: “Government Spending Always Crowds Out Private Spending”</strong></span> Some claim that expansionary fiscal policy can never raise aggregate spending and therefore can never raise aggregate income, with reasons that go something like this: “Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken away from the private sector. So any rise in government spending must be offset by an equal fall in private spending.” In other words, every dollar spent by the government <em>crowds out,</em> or displaces, a dollar of private spending.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p60"><p>What’s wrong with this view? The answer is that it assumes that resources in the economy are always fully employed and, as a result, the aggregate income earned in the economy is always a fixed sum—which isn’t true. In reality, whether or not government spending crowds out private spending depends upon the state of the economy. In particular, when the economy is suffering from a recessionary gap, there are unemployed resources in the economy and output, and therefore income, is below its potential level. Expansionary fiscal policy during these periods puts unemployed resources to work and generates higher spending and higher income. Government spending crowds out private spending only when the economy is operating at full employment. So the argument that expansionary fiscal policy always crowds out private spending is wrong in principle.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p61"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Claim 2: “Government Borrowing Always Crowds Out Private Investment Spending”</strong></span> How valid is the argument that government borrowing uses funds that would have otherwise been used for private investment spending—that is, it crowds out private investment spending?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p62"><p>The answer is that “it depends.” Specifically, it depends on whether the economy is depressed or not. If the economy is not depressed, then increased government borrowing, by increasing the demand for loanable funds, can raise interest rates and crowd out private investment spending. However, what if the economy is depressed? In that case, crowding out is much less likely. When the economy is at far less than full employment, a fiscal expansion will lead to higher incomes, which in turn leads to increased savings at any given interest rate. This larger pool of savings allows the government to borrow without driving up interest rates. The Recovery Act of 2009 was a case in point: despite high levels of government borrowing, U.S. interest rates stayed near historic lows.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p63"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Claim 3: “Government Budget Deficits Lead to Reduced Private Spending”</strong></span> Other things equal, expansionary fiscal policy leads to a larger budget deficit and greater government debt. And higher debt will eventually require the government to raise taxes to pay it off. So, according to the third argument against expansionary fiscal policy, consumers, anticipating that they must pay higher taxes in the future to pay off today’s government debt, will cut their spending today in order to save money. This argument, first made by nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo, is known as <em>Ricardian equivalence</em>. It is an argument often taken to imply that expansionary fiscal policy will have no effect on the economy because far-sighted consumers will undo any attempts at expansion by the government. (And will also undo any contractionary fiscal policy, for that matter.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p64"><p>In reality, however, it’s doubtful that consumers behave with such foresight and budgeting discipline. Most people, when provided with extra cash (generated by the fiscal expansion), will spend at least some of it. So even fiscal policy that takes the form of temporary tax cuts or transfers of cash to consumers probably does have an expansionary effect.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p65"><p>Moreover, it’s possible to show that even with Ricardian equivalence, a temporary rise in government spending that involves direct purchases of goods and services—such as a program of road construction—would still lead to a boost in total spending in the near term. That’s because even if consumers cut back their current spending in anticipation of higher future taxes, their reduced spending will take place over an extended period as consumers save over time to pay the future tax bill. Meanwhile, the additional government spending will be concentrated in the near future, when the economy needs it.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p66"><p>So although the effects emphasized by Ricardian equivalence may reduce the impact of fiscal expansion, the claim that it makes fiscal expansion completely ineffective is neither consistent with how consumers actually behave nor a reason to believe that increases in government spending have no effect. So, in the end, it’s not a valid argument against expansionary fiscal policy. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p67"><p>In sum, then, the extent to which we should expect expansionary fiscal policy to work depends upon the circumstances. When the economy has a recessionary gap—as it did when the 2009 Recovery Act was passed—economics tells us that this is just the kind of situation in which expansionary fiscal policy helps the economy. However, when the economy is already at full employment, expansionary fiscal policy is the wrong policy and will lead to crowding out, an overheated economy, and higher inflation.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p68"><p>Looking back at <span data-type="link" data-href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-fig-5">Figures 17-4</span> and <span data-type="link" data-href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-fig-6">17-5</span>, it may seem obvious that the government should actively use fiscal policy—always adopting an expansionary fiscal policy when the economy faces a recessionary gap and always adopting a contractionary fiscal policy when the economy faces an inflationary gap. But many economists caution against an extremely active stabilization policy, arguing that a government that tries too hard to stabilize the economy—through either fiscal policy or monetary policy—can end up making the economy less stable.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch17_page_482"><p>482</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p69"><p>We’ll leave discussion of the warnings associated with monetary policy to <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch19_1.html">Chapter 19</span>. In the case of fiscal policy, one key reason for caution is that there are important <em>time lags</em> between when the policy is decided upon and when it is implemented. To understand the nature of these lags, think about what has to happen before the government increases spending to fight a recessionary gap. First, the government has to realize that the recessionary gap exists: economic data take time to collect and analyze, and recessions are often recognized only months after they have begun. Second, the government has to develop a spending plan, which can itself take months, particularly if politicians take time debating how the money should be spent and passing legislation. Finally, it takes time to spend money. For example, a road construction project begins with activities such as surveying that don’t involve spending large sums. It may be quite some time before the big spending begins.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p70"><p>Because of these lags, an attempt to increase spending to fight a recessionary gap may take so long to get going that the economy has already recovered on its own. In fact, the recessionary gap may have turned into an inflationary gap by the time the fiscal policy takes effect. In that case, the fiscal policy will make things worse instead of better.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p71"><p>This doesn’t mean that fiscal policy should never be actively used. In early 2009 there was good reason to believe that the slump facing the U.S. economy would be both deep and long and that a fiscal stimulus designed to arrive over the next year or two would almost surely push aggregate demand in the right direction. In fact, as we’ll soon see the 2009 stimulus arguably faded out too soon, leaving the economy still deeply depressed. But the problem of lags makes the actual use of both fiscal and monetary policy harder than you might think from a simple analysis like the one we have just given.</p></div>

But a fourth category, “transfers to state and local governments,” accounted for roughly a third of the funds. Why this fourth category? </p></div>
