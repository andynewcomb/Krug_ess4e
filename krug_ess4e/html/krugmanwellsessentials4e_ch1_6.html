<ol data-block_type="numbered">
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-48"><p>An <strong>economy</strong> is a system for coordinating society’s productive activities, and <strong>economics</strong> is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The United States has a <strong>market economy—</strong>an economy in which decisions about production and consumption are made by individual producers and consumers pursuing their own self-interest. The <strong>invisible hand</strong> harnesses the power of self-interest for the good of society.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-49"><p><strong>Microeconomics</strong> is the branch of economics that studies how people make decisions and how these decisions interact. <strong>Market failure</strong> occurs when the individual pursuit of self-interest leads to bad results for society as a whole.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-50"><p><strong>Macroeconomics</strong> is the branch of economics that is concerned with overall ups and downs in the economy. Despite occasional <strong>recessions,</strong> the U.S. economy has achieved long-run <strong>economic growth.</strong></p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-51"><p>All economic analysis is based on a set of basic principles that apply to three levels of economic activity. First, we study how individuals make choices; second, we study how these choices interact; and third, we study how the economy functions overall.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-52"><p>Everyone has to make choices about what to do and what <em>not</em> to do. <strong>Individual choice</strong> is the basis of economics—if it doesn’t involve choice, it isn’t economics.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-53"><p>The reason choices must be made is that <strong>resources—</strong>anything that can be used to produce something else—are <strong>scarce.</strong> Individuals are limited in their choices by money and time; economies are limited by their supplies of human and natural resources.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-54"><p>Because you must choose among limited alternatives, the true cost of anything is what you must give up to get it—all costs are <strong>opportunity costs.</strong></p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-55"><p>Many economic decisions involve questions not of “whether” but of “how much”—how much to spend on some good, how much to produce, and so on. Such decisions must be made by performing a <strong>trade-off</strong> <em>at the margin</em>—by comparing the costs and benefits of doing a bit more or a bit less. Decisions of this type are called <strong>marginal decisions,</strong> and the study of them, <strong>marginal analysis,</strong> plays a central role in economics.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-56"><p>The study of how people <em>should</em> make decisions is also a good way to understand actual behavior. Individuals usually respond to <strong>incentives—</strong>exploiting opportunities to make themselves better off.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-57"><p>The next level of economic analysis is the study of <strong>interaction—</strong>how my choices depend on your choices, and vice versa. When individuals interact, the end result may be different from what anyone intends.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-58"><p>Individuals interact because there are <strong>gains from trade:</strong> by engaging in the <strong>trade</strong> of goods and services with one another, the members of an economy can all be made better off. <strong>Specialization—</strong>each person specializes in the task he or she is good at—is the source of gains from trade.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_20"><p>20</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-59"><p>Because individuals usually respond to incentives, markets normally move toward <strong>equilibrium—</strong>a situation in which no individual can make himself or herself better off by taking a different action.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-60"><p>An economy is <strong>efficient</strong> if all opportunities to make some people better off without making other people worse off are taken. Resources should be used as efficiently as possible to achieve society’s goals. But efficiency is not the sole way to evaluate an economy: <strong>equity,</strong> or fairness, is also desirable, and there is often a trade-off between equity and efficiency.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-61"><p>Markets usually lead to efficiency, with some well-defined exceptions.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-62"><p>When markets fail and do not achieve efficiency, government intervention can improve society’s welfare.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-63"><p>Because people in a market economy earn income by selling things, including their own labor, one person’s spending is another person’s income. As a result, changes in spending behavior can spread throughout the economy.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-64"><p>Overall spending in the economy can get out of line with the economy’s productive capacity. Spending below the economy’s productive capacity leads to a recession; spending in excess of the economy’s productive capacity leads to inflation.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch1-li-65"><p>Governments have the ability to strongly affect overall spending, an ability they use in an effort to steer the economy between recession and inflation.</p></div>
