<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p17"><p>The key statistic used to track economic growth is <em>real GDP per capita—</em>real GDP divided by the population size.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p18"><p>We focus on GDP because, as we learned in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch13_1.html">Chapter 13</span>, GDP measures the total value of an economy’s production of final goods and services as well as the income earned in that economy in a given year. We use <em>real</em> GDP because we want to separate changes in the quantity of goods and services from the effects of a rising price level. We focus on real GDP <em>per capita</em> because we want to isolate the effect of changes in the population. For example, other things equal, an increase in the population lowers the standard of living for the average person—there are now more people to share a given amount of real GDP. An increase in real GDP that only matches an increase in population leaves the average standard of living unchanged.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p19"><p>Although we also learned that growth in real GDP per capita should not be a policy goal in and of itself, it does serve as a very useful summary measure of a country’s economic progress over time. <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-fig-2">Figure 15-1</span> shows real GDP per capita for the United States, India, and China, measured in 1990 dollars, from 1900 to 2010.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p21"><p>The income of the typical family normally grows more or less in proportion to per capita income. For example, a 1% increase in real GDP per capita corresponds, roughly, to a 1% increase in the income of the median or typical family—a family at the center of the income distribution. In 2010, the median American household had an income of about $50,000. Since <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-tab-1">Table 15-1</span> tells us that real GDP per capita in 1900 was only 13% of its 2010 level, a typical family in 1900 probably had a purchasing power only 13% as large as the purchasing power of a typical family in 2010. That’s around $6,850 in today’s dollars, representing a standard of living that we would now consider severe poverty. Today’s typical American family, if transported back to the United States of 1900, would feel quite a lot of deprivation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p22"><p>Yet many people in the world have a standard of living equal to or lower than that of the United States at the beginning of the last century. That’s the message about China and India in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-fig-2">Figure 15-1</span>: despite dramatic economic growth in China over the last three decades and the less dramatic acceleration of economic growth in India, China has only recently exceeded the standard of living that the United States enjoyed in the early twentieth century, while India is still poorer than the United States was at that time. And much of the world today is poorer than China or India.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p23"><p>You can get a sense of how poor much of the world remains by looking at <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-fig-3">Figure 15-2</span>, a map of the world in which countries are classified according to their 2013 levels of GDP per capita, in U.S. dollars. As you can see, large parts of the world have very low incomes. Generally speaking, the countries of Europe and North America, as well as a few in the Pacific, have high incomes. The rest of the world, containing most of its population, is dominated by countries with GDP less than $5,000 per capita—and often much less. In fact, today about 50% of the world’s people live in countries with a lower standard of living than the United States had a century ago.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p25"><p>When studying economic growth, it’s vitally important to understand the difference between a change in level and a rate of change. When we say that real GDP “grew,” we mean that the level of real GDP increased. For example, we might say that U.S. real GDP grew during 2013 by $297 billion.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p26"><p>If we knew the level of U.S. real GDP in 2012, we could also represent the amount of 2013 growth in terms of a rate of change. For example, if U.S. real GDP in 2012 had been $15,470 billion, then U.S. real GDP in 2013 would have been $15,470 billion + $297 billion = $15,767 billion. We could calculate the rate of change, or the growth rate, of U.S. real GDP during 2013 as: (($15,767 billion − $15,470 billion)/$15,470 billion) × 100 = ($297 billion/$15,470 billion) × 100 = 1.92%. Statements about economic growth over a period of years almost always refer to changes in the growth rate.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p27"><p>When talking about growth or growth rates, economists often use phrases that appear to mix the two concepts and so can be confusing. For example, when we say that “U.S. growth fell during the 1970s,” we are really saying that the U.S. growth rate of real GDP was lower in the 1970s in comparison to the 1960s. When we say that “growth accelerated during the early 1990s,” we are saying that the growth rate increased year after year in the early 1990s—for example, going from 3% to 3.5% to 4%.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p28"><p>How did the United States manage to produce over eight times as much per person in 2013 than in 1900? A little bit at a time. Long-run economic growth is normally a gradual process in which real GDP per capita grows at most a few percent per year. From 1900 to 2013, real GDP per capita in the United States increased an average of 1.9% each year.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p30"><p>For a sense of the relationship between the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita and the long-run change in real GDP per capita, it’s helpful to keep in mind the <strong>Rule of 70,</strong> a mathematical formula that tells us how long it takes real GDP per capita, or any other variable that grows gradually over time, to double. The approximate answer is:</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p31"><p>(Note that the Rule of 70 can only be applied to a positive growth rate.) So if real GDP per capita grows at 1% per year, it will take 70 years to double. If it grows at 2% per year, it will take only 35 years to double. In fact, U.S. real GDP per capita rose on average 1.9% per year over the last century. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p32"><p>Applying the Rule of 70 to this information implies that it should have taken 37 years for real GDP per capita to double; it would have taken 111 years—three periods of 37 years each—for U.S. real GDP per capita to double three times. That is, the Rule of 70 implies that over the course of 111 years, U.S. real GDP per capita should have increased by a factor of 2 × 2 × 2 = 8. And this does turn out to be a pretty good approximation of reality. Between 1899 and 2010—a period of 111 years—real GDP per capita rose just about eightfold.</p></div>

For more than three decades after independence, however, this happy political story was partly overshadowed by economic disappointment. Despite ambitious economic development plans, India’s performance was consistently sluggish. In 1980, India’s real GDP per capita was only about 50% higher than it had been in 1947. The gap between Indian living standards and those in wealthy countries like the United States had been growing rather than shrinking.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p39"><p>Since then, however, India has done much better.

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p40"><p>What went right in India after 1980? Many economists point to policy reforms. For decades after independence, India had a tightly controlled, highly regulated economy. Today, things are very different: a series of reforms opened the economy to international trade and freed up domestic competition. Some economists, however, argue that this can’t be the main story because the big policy reforms weren’t adopted until 1991, yet growth accelerated around 1980.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p42"><p>The big question now is whether this growth can continue. Skeptics argue that there are important bottlenecks in the Indian economy that may constrain future growth. They point in particular to the still low education level of much of India’s population and inadequate infrastructure—that is, the poor quality and limited capacity of the country’s roads, railroads, power supplies, and health and sanitation infrastructure. Pollution is a severe and growing problem as well. But India’s economy has defied the skeptics for several decades and the hope is that it can continue doing so.</p></div>
