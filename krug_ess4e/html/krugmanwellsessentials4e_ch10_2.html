In a modern economy there are many examples of an external cost that an individual or firm imposes on others.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p21"><p>Pollution is a bad thing. Yet most pollution is a side effect of activities that provide us with good things: our air is polluted by power plants generating the electricity that lights our cities, and groundwater contamination may occur from hydraulic fracturing or fracking, which also produces cleaner-burning fuel. Recall from <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch3_1.html">Chapter 3</span> that <em>fracking</em> is a method of extracting natural gas or oil from deposits trapped between layers of shale rock thousands of feet underground, using powerful jets of liquid.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p22"><p>Why shouldn’t we accept a certain amount of pollution as the cost of a good life? Actually, we do. Even highly committed environmentalists don’t think that we can or should completely eliminate pollution—even an environmentally conscious society would accept <em>some</em> pollution as the cost of producing useful goods and services. What environmentalists argue is that unless there is a strong and effective environmental policy, our society will generate <em>too much</em> pollution—too much of a bad thing. And the great majority of economists agree.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p26"><p>The National Safety Council urges people not to use cell phones while driving. Most states have some restrictions on cell phone use while driving. But in response to a growing number of accidents, several states have banned cell phone use behind the wheel altogether. Cell phone use while driving is illegal in many other countries as well, including Japan and Israel.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p27"><p>Why not leave the decision up to drivers? Because the safety risk posed extends beyond the drivers to include others—their passengers, pedestrians, and people in other cars. Even if drivers decide that the benefit of using a cell phone while driving is worth the cost, they aren’t taking into account the cost to other people. Driving while using a cell phone, in other words, generates a serious—and sometimes fatal—negative externality.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p29"><p>How much pollution should society allow? To answer this “how much” question, recall the <em>principle of marginal analysis</em> that we learned about in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch7_1.html">Chapter 7</span>. This principle always involves comparing the marginal benefit from an additional unit of something with the marginal cost of that additional unit. The same is true of pollution.</p></div>

Likewise, groundwater contamination, which may be a side effect of fracking, damages health. Typically, the marginal social cost of pollution is increasing—each additional unit of pollution emitted causes a greater level of damage than the unit before. That’s because nature can often safely handle low levels of pollution but is increasingly harmed as pollution reaches higher levels.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p34"><p>The <strong>marginal social benefit of pollution</strong> is the benefit to society from an additional unit of pollution. This may seem like a confusing concept—how can there be any benefit to society from pollution? The answer lies in the understanding that pollution can be reduced—but at a cost. For example, air pollution from coal-fired power plants can be reduced by using more-expensive coal and expensive scrubbing technology; contamination of drinking water due to fracking can be limited with more-expensive drilling techniques; wastewater contamination of rivers and oceans can be reduced by building water treatment facilities.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p35"><p>All these methods of reducing pollution have an opportunity cost. That is, avoiding pollution requires using scarce resources that could have been employed to produce other goods and services. So the marginal social benefit of pollution is the goods and services that could be had by society if it tolerated another unit of pollution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p36"><p>Comparisons between the pollution levels tolerated in rich and poor countries illustrate the importance of the level of the marginal social benefit of pollution in deciding how much pollution a society wishes to tolerate. Because poor countries have a higher opportunity cost of resources spent on reducing pollution than richer countries, they tolerate higher levels of pollution. For example, the World Health Organization has estimated that 3.5 million people in poor countries die prematurely from breathing polluted indoor air caused by burning dirty fuels like wood, dung, and coal to heat and cook—a situation that residents of rich countries can afford to avoid.</p></div>

The upward-sloping marginal social cost curve, <em>MSC,</em> shows how the marginal cost to society of an additional unit of pollution varies with the quantity of pollution. As we mentioned, marginal social cost of pollution is typically increasing, as another unit of pollution causes more harm than prior units. The marginal social benefit curve, <em>MSB,</em> is downward sloping. At high levels of pollution, the cost of achieving a reduction in pollution is fairly small. However, as pollution levels drop, it becomes progressively more costly to engineer a further fall in pollution as more expensive techniques must be used, so the <em>MSB</em> is higher at lower levels of pollution.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p41"><p>While pollution yields both benefits and costs to society, in a market economy without government intervention too much pollution will be produced. In that case it is polluters alone— owners of power plants or gas-drilling companies, for example—who decide how much pollution is created. And they have no incentive to take into account the cost that pollution imposes on others.</p></div>

In a market economy without government intervention, since polluters are the only ones making the decisions, only the benefits of pollution are taken into account when choosing how much pollution to produce. So instead of producing the socially optimal quantity, <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub>,</em> the market economy will generate the amount <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub>.</em> At <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub>,</em> the marginal social benefit of an additional unit of pollution is zero, while the marginal social cost of an additional unit is much higher—$400.</p></div>

Well, take a moment to consider what the polluter would do if he found himself emitting <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub></em> of pollution. Remember that the <em>MSB</em> curve represents the resources made available by tolerating one more unit of pollution. The polluter would notice that if he increases his emission of pollution by moving down the <em>MSB</em> curve from <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub></em> to <em>Q<sub>H</sub>,</em> he would gain $200 – $100 = $100. That gain of $100 comes from using less-expensive but higher-emission production techniques. Remember, he suffers none of the costs of doing this—only others do. However, it won’t stop there. At <em>Q<sub>H</sub>,</em> he notices that if he increases his emissions from <em>Q<sub>H</sub></em> to <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub>,</em> he would gain another $100 as he moves down the <em>MSB</em> curve yet again. This would be achieved by using even cheaper and higher-emission production techniques. He will stop at <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub></em> because at this emission level the marginal social benefit of a unit of pollution is zero. That is, at <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub></em> he gains nothing by using yet cheaper and dirtier production techniques and emitting more pollution.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p44"><p>The market outcome, <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub></em>, is inefficient. Recall that an outcome is inefficient if someone could be made better off without someone else being made worse off. At an inefficient outcome, a mutually beneficial trade is being missed. At <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub>,</em> the benefit accruing to the polluter of the last unit of pollution is very low—virtually zero. But the cost imposed on society of that last unit of pollution is quite high—$400. So by reducing the quantity of pollution at <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub></em> by one unit, the total social cost of pollution falls by $400 but the total social benefit falls by virtually zero.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p45"><p>So total surplus rises by approximately $400 if the quantity of pollution at <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub></em> is reduced by one unit. At <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub>,</em> society would be willing to pay the polluter up to $400 not to emit the last unit of pollution, and the polluter would be willing to accept their offer since that last unit gains him virtually nothing. But because there is no means in this market economy for this transaction to take place, an inefficient outcome occurs.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p49"><p>For an illustration of how the Coase theorem might work, consider the case of groundwater contamination caused by drilling. There are two ways a private transaction can address this problem. First, landowners whose groundwater is at risk of contamination can pay drillers to use more-expensive, less-polluting technology. Second, the drilling companies can pay landowners the value of damage to their groundwater sources—say, by buying their properties outright so that the landowners move. If drillers legally have the right to pollute, then the first outcome is more likely. If drillers don’t legally have the right to pollute, then the second is more likely.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p55"><p>In some cases, people do find ways to reduce transaction costs, allowing them to internalize externalities. For example, a house with a junk-filled yard and peeling paint imposes a negative externality on the neighboring houses, diminishing their value in the eyes of potential home buyers. So, many people live in private communities that set rules for home maintenance and behavior, making bargaining between neighbors unnecessary. But in many other cases, transaction costs are too high to make it possible to deal with externalities through private action. For example, tens of millions of people are adversely affected by acid rain. It would be prohibitively expensive to try to make a deal among all those people and all those power companies.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p59"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">I</span>n 2011, three leading economists, Nicholas Z. Muller, Robert Mendelsohn, and William Nordhaus, published a paper drawn from the results of an ambitious study that estimated the external cost of pollution generated by 10,000 pollution sources in the United States, broken down by industry. In it they model the costs to society of emissions of six major pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, fine particulate matter, and coarse particulate matter. The costs took a variety of forms, from harmful effects on health to reduced agricultural yields. In the case of the electricity-generating sector, the authors also included the cost to society from carbon dioxide emissions—one of many greenhouse gases, the pollution that causes climate change. For each industry a total external cost of pollution, or TEC, was calculated and then compared to the total value to society, or TVC, created by that industry.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p60"><p>An industry with a TEC/TVC ratio greater than 1 indicates that the external cost of pollution exceeds the value created. In other words, a ratio greater than 1 means that a marginal reduction in both industry output and its ensuing pollution increases total social welfare. But as the authors of the study emphasize, this doesn’t mean that the industry should be shut down. Rather, it means that the current level of pollution emitted is too high. A contentious issue in any model of the external cost of greenhouse gases—commonly known as SCC, the social cost of carbon—is exactly what price to assign to it. That’s because the negative effects of climate change fall most heavily on future generations.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p61"><p>So how do you value today the cost imposed on those not yet born? A difficult question, for sure. Economists address this puzzle by using a range of estimates for SCC. For example, in November 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, the federal agency tasked with protecting the environment, published estimates ranging from $12 to $116 and settled on a cost of $37 per metric ton of carbon dioxide.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p62"><p>Using a relatively conservative estimate of $27 for SCC, Muller, Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus compare the TEC/TVC ratio and the TEC per kilowatt-hour produced for two types of electricity generation—coal-fired plants and natural gas–fired plants.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p63"><p>As you can see, both modes of electricity generation are under-regulated: with TEC/TVC ratios greater than 1, society would benefit from a reduction in their emissions. And although both emit greenhouse gases, the TEC per kilowatt-hour generated with natural gas is nearly one-eighth the cost of one generated with coal. That’s because natural gas burns cleaner than coal and produces less-toxic pollutants. With the average kilowatt-hour in the United States costing a little over $0.11 in 2013, a conservative estimate of the external cost of that kilowatt hour is one-third of the retail price when generated by coal, and one-twentieth when generated by natural gas.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p64"><p>In response to growing concerns about carbon emissions, in early 2014 the EPA issued rules that limited the amount of carbon emitted by newly constructed coal-fired and natural gas–fired plants. The rules are unlikely to hinder the construction of new natural gas–fired plants because the latest technology meets the standard. Under the new rules, however, new coal-fired plants cannot be built unless they use carbon-capture and storage technology, which captures 20% to 40% of their carbon emissions and stores them underground. While coal advocates argue that the new rules will effectively stop construction of new coal-fired plants, market forces have increasingly tilted toward natural gas over coal as the use of fracking has made the cost of natural gas plummet.</p></div>
