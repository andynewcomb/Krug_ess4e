<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p12"><p>The market in used textbooks is a big business in terms of dollars and cents—several billion dollars each year. More importantly for us, it is a convenient starting point for developing the concepts of consumer and producer surplus. We’ll use the concepts of consumer and producer surplus to understand exactly how buyers and sellers benefit from a competitive market and how big those benefits are. In addition, these concepts play important roles in analyzing what happens when competitive markets don’t work well or there is interference in the market.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p13"><p>So let’s begin by looking at the market for used textbooks, starting with the buyers. The key point, as we’ll see in a minute, is that the demand curve is derived from their tastes or preferences—and that those same preferences also determine how much they gain from the opportunity to buy used books.</p></div>

How much this bothers you depends on your preferences. Some potential buyers would prefer to buy the used book even if it is only slightly cheaper than a new book, but others would buy the used book only if it is considerably cheaper.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p18"><p>How many of these five students will actually buy a used book? It depends on the price. If the price of a used book is $55, only Aleisha buys one; if the price is $40, Aleisha and Brad both buy used books, and so on. So the information in the table on willingness to pay also defines the <em>demand schedule</em> for used textbooks.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p21"><p>Aleisha would have been willing to pay $59, so her net gain is $59 − $30 = $29.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p25"><p>The sum of the individual consumer surpluses achieved by all the buyers of a good is known as the <strong>total consumer surplus</strong> achieved in the market.

<div data-block_type="mn-def" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p26"><p>The term <strong>consumer surplus</strong> is often used to refer to both individual and total consumer surplus.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p27"><p>Economists often use the term <strong>consumer surplus</strong> to refer to both individual and total consumer surplus. We will follow this practice; it will always be clear in context whether we are referring to the consumer surplus achieved by an individual or by all buyers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p28"><p>Total consumer surplus can be represented graphically. As we saw in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch3_1.html">Chapter 3</span>, we can use the demand schedule to derive the market demand curve shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch4-fig-006">Figure 4-1</span>. Because we are considering only a small number of consumers, this curve doesn’t look like the smooth demand curves of <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch3_1.html">Chapter 3</span>, where markets contained hundreds or thousands of consumers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p29"><p>This demand curve is stepped, with alternating horizontal and vertical segments. Each horizontal segment—each step—corresponds to one potential buyer’s willingness to pay. Each step in that demand curve is one book wide and represents one consumer. For example, the height of Aleisha’s step is $59, her willingness to pay. This step forms the top of a rectangle, with $30—the price she actually pays for a book—forming the bottom. The area of Aleisha’s rectangle, ($59 − $30) × 1 = $29, is her consumer surplus from purchasing one book at $30. So the individual consumer surplus Aleisha gains is the <em>area of the dark blue rectangle</em> shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch4/KrugESS4e_fig_4_01.html">Figure 4-1</span>.</p></div>

<span data-type="number">Figure 4.1: </span><span data-type="caption">At a price of $30, Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia each buy a book but Darren and Edwina do not. Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia receive individual consumer surpluses equal to the difference between their willingness to pay and the price, illustrated by the areas of the shaded rectangles. Both Darren and Edwina have a willingness to pay less than $30, so they are unwilling to buy a book in this market; they receive zero consumer surplus. The total consumer surplus is given by the entire shaded area—the sum of the individual consumer surpluses of Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia—equal to $29 + $15 + $5 = $49.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p30"><p>In addition to Aleisha, Brad and Claudia will also each buy a book when the price is $30. Like Aleisha, they benefit from their purchases, though not as much, because they each have a lower willingness to pay. <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch4/KrugESS4e_fig_4_01.html">Figure 4-1</span> also shows the consumer surplus gained by Brad and Claudia; again, this can be measured by the areas of the appropriate rectangles. Darren and Edwina, because they do not buy books at a price of $30, receive no consumer surplus.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_104"><p>104</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p31"><p>The total consumer surplus achieved in this market is just the sum of the individual consumer surpluses received by Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia. So total consumer surplus is equal to the combined area of the three rectangles—the entire shaded area in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch4/KrugESS4e_fig_4_01.html">Figure 4-1</span>. Another way to say this is that total consumer surplus is equal to the area below the demand curve but above the price.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p32"><p><span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch4/KrugESS4e_fig_4_01.html">Figure 4-1</span> illustrates the following general principle: <em>the total consumer surplus generated by purchases of a good at a given price is equal to the area below the demand curve but above that price</em>. The same principle applies regardless of the number of consumers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p33"><p>When we consider large markets, this graphical representation becomes extremely helpful. Consider, for example, the sales of iPads to millions of potential buyers. Each potential buyer has a maximum price that he or she is willing to pay.

</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p34"><p>Suppose that at a price of $500, a total of 1 million iPads are purchased. How much do consumers gain from being able to buy those 1 million iPads? We could answer that question by calculating the consumer surplus of each individual buyer and then adding these numbers up to arrive at a total. But it is much easier just to look at <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch4/KrugESS4e_fig_4_02.html">Figure 4-2</span> and use the fact that the total consumer surplus is equal to the shaded area. As in our original example, consumer surplus is equal to the area below the demand curve but above the price.
