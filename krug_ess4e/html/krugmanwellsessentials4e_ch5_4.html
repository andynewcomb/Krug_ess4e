<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0148"><p>The quantity of a good demanded depends not only on the price of that good but also on other variables. In particular, demand curves shift because of changes in the prices of related goods and changes in consumers’ incomes. It is often important to have a measure of these other effects, and the best measures are—you guessed it—elasticities. Specifically, we can best measure how the demand for a good is affected by prices of other goods using a measure called the <em>cross-price elasticity of demand,</em> and we can best measure how demand is affected by changes in income using the <em>income elasticity of demand.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-gl-def" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0149"><p>The <strong>cross-price elasticity of demand</strong> between two goods measures the effect of the change in one good’s price on the quantity demanded of the other good. It is equal to the percent change in the quantity demanded of one good divided by the percent change in the other good’s price.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0150"><p>In <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch3_1.html">Chapter 3</span> you learned that the demand for a good is often affected by the prices of other, related goods—goods that are substitutes or complements. There you saw that a change in the price of a related good shifts the demand curve of the original good, reflecting a change in the quantity demanded at any given price. The strength of such a “cross” effect on demand can be measured by the <strong>cross-price elasticity of demand,</strong> defined as the ratio of the percent change in the quantity demanded of one good to the percent change in the price of the other.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0151"><p><strong>(5-7)</strong> Cross-price elasticity of demand between goods A and B = <img id="" src="asset/ch5/KrugESS4e_5UN27.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0153"><p>When two goods are substitutes, like hot dogs and hamburgers, the cross-price elasticity of demand is positive: a rise in the price of hot dogs increases the demand for hamburgers—that is, it causes a rightward shift of the demand curve for hamburgers. If the goods are close substitutes, the cross-price elasticity will be positive and large; if they are not close substitutes, the cross-price elasticity will be positive and small. So when the cross-price elasticity of demand is positive, its size is a measure of how closely substitutable the two goods are, with a higher number meaning the goods are closer substitutes.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_151"><p>151</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0154"><p>When two goods are complements, like hot dogs and hot dog buns, the cross-price elasticity is negative: a rise in the price of hot dogs decreases the demand for hot dog buns—that is, it causes a leftward shift of the demand curve for hot dog buns. As with substitutes, the size of the cross-price elasticity of demand between two complements tells us how strongly complementary they are: if the cross-price elasticity is only slightly below zero, they are weak complements; if it is very negative, they are strong complements.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0155"><p>Note that in the case of the cross-price elasticity of demand, the sign (plus or minus) is very important: it tells us whether the two goods are complements or substitutes. So we cannot drop the minus sign as we did for the price elasticity of demand.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0156"><p>Our discussion of the cross-price elasticity of demand is a useful place to return to a point we made earlier: elasticity is a <em>unit-free</em> measure—that is, it doesn’t depend on the units in which goods are measured.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0157"><p>To see the potential problem, suppose someone told you that “if the price of hot dog buns rises by $0.30, Americans will buy 10 million fewer hot dogs this year.” If you’ve ever bought hot dog buns, you’ll immediately wonder: is that a $0.30 increase in the price <em>per bun,</em> or is it a $0.30 increase in the price <em>per package</em> (buns are usually sold in packages of eight). It makes a big difference what units we are talking about! However, if someone says that the crossprice elasticity of demand between buns and hot dogs is −0.3, it doesn’t matter whether buns are sold individually or by the package. So elasticity is defined as a ratio of percent changes, as a way of making sure that confusion over units doesn’t arise.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="idp3956656"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">T</span>he U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics carries out extensive surveys of how families spend their incomes. This is not just a matter of intellectual curiosity. Quite a few government benefit programs involve some adjustment for changes in the cost of living; to estimate those changes, the government must know how people spend their money. But an additional payoff to these surveys is data on the income elasticity of demand for various goods.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0173"><p>What stands out from these studies? The classic result is that the income elasticity of demand for “food eaten at home” is considerably less than 1: as a family’s income rises, the share of its income spent on food consumed at home falls. Correspondingly, the lower a family’s income, the higher the share of income spent on food consumed at home.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0174"><p>In poor countries, many families spend more than half their income on food consumed at home. Although the income elasticity of demand for “food eaten at home” is estimated at less than 0.5 in the United States, the income elasticity of demand for “food eaten away from home” (restaurant meals) is estimated to be much higher—close to 1.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0175"><p>Families with higher incomes eat out more often and at fancier places. In 1950, about 19% of U.S. income was spent on food consumed at home, a number that has dropped to 6.1% in 2012. But over the same time period, the share of U.S. income spent on food consumed away from home has stayed constant at 5%. In fact, a sure sign of rising income levels in developing countries is the arrival of fast-food restaurants that cater to newly affluent customers. For example, McDonald’s can now be found in Hanoi, Jakarta, and Mumbai.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0176"><p>There is one clear example of an inferior good found in the surveys: rental housing. Families with higher income actually spend less on rent than families with lower income, because they are much more likely to own their own homes. And the category identified as “other housing”—which basically means second homes—is highly income-elastic. Only higher-income families can afford a luxury like a vacation home, so “other housing” has an income elasticity of demand greater than 1.</p></div>
