<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p154"><p>From 1929 to 1933, the U.S. economy moved down the short-run aggregate supply curve as the aggregate price level fell. In contrast, from 1979 to 1980 the U.S. economy moved up the aggregate demand curve as the aggregate price level rose. In each case, the cause of the movement along the curve was a shift of the other curve. In 1929–1933, it was a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve—a major fall in consumer spending. In 1979–1980, it was a leftward shift of the short-run aggregate supply curve—a dramatic fall in short-run aggregate supply caused by the oil price shock.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p161"><p>In the supply and demand model we saw that a shortage of any individual good causes its market price to rise but a surplus of the good causes its market price to fall. These forces ensure that the market reaches equilibrium. The same logic applies to short-run macroeconomic equilibrium. If the aggregate price level is above its equilibrium level, the quantity of aggregate output supplied exceeds the quantity of aggregate output demanded. This leads to a fall in the aggregate price level and pushes it toward its equilibrium level. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p162"><p>If the aggregate price level is below its equilibrium level, the quantity of aggregate output supplied is less than the quantity of aggregate output demanded. This leads to a rise in the aggregate price level, again pushing it toward its equilibrium level. In the discussion that follows, we’ll assume that the economy is always in short-run macroeconomic equilibrium.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p163"><p>We’ll also make another important simplification based on the observation that in reality there is a long-term upward trend in both aggregate output and the aggregate price level. We’ll assume that a fall in either variable really means a fall compared to the long-run trend. For example, if the aggregate price level normally rises 4% per year, a year in which the aggregate price level rises only 3% would count, for our purposes, as a 1% decline. In fact, since the Great Depression there have been very few years in which the aggregate price level of any major nation actually declined—Japan’s period of deflation since 1995 is one of the few exceptions. There have, however, been many cases in which the aggregate price level fell relative to the long-run trend.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p164"><p>Short-run equilibrium aggregate output and the short-run equilibrium aggregate price level can change either because of shifts of the <em>AD</em> curve or because of shifts of the <em>SRAS</em> curve.

<div data-block_type="bx3-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p192"><p>The <em>AD–AS</em> model says that either a negative demand shock or a positive supply shock should lead to a fall in the aggregate price level—that is, deflation. However, since 1949, an actual fall in the aggregate price level has been a rare occurrence in the United States. Similarly, most other countries have had little or no experience with deflation. Japan, which experienced sustained mild deflation in the late 1990s and the early part of the next decade, is the big (and much discussed) exception. What happened to deflation?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p193"><p>The basic answer is that since World War II economic fluctuations have largely taken place around a long-run inflationary trend. Before the war, it was common for prices to fall during recessions, but since then negative demand shocks have largely been reflected in a <em>decline in the rate of inflation</em> rather than an actual fall in prices. For example, the rate of consumer price inflation fell from more than 3% at the beginning of the 2001 recession to 1.1% a year later, but it never went below zero.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p194"><p>All of this changed during the recession of 2007–2009. The negative demand shock that followed the 2008 financial crisis was so severe that, for most of 2009, consumer prices in the United States indeed fell. But the deflationary period didn’t last long: beginning in 2010, prices again rose, at a rate of between 1% and 4% per year.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p195"><p>As in the case of a recessionary gap, this isn’t the end of the story. In the face of low unemployment, nominal wages will rise, as will other sticky prices. An inflationary gap causes the short-run aggregate supply curve to shift gradually to the left as producers reduce output in the face of rising nominal wages. This process continues until <em>SRAS</em><sub>1</sub> reaches its new position at <em>SRAS</em><sub>2</sub>, bringing the economy to equilibrium at <em>E</em><sub>3</sub>, where <em>AD</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>SRAS</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em>LRAS</em> all intersect. At <em>E</em><sub>3</sub>, the economy is back in long-run macroeconomic equilibrium. It is back at potential output, but at a higher price level, <em>P</em><sub>3</sub>, reflecting a long-run rise in the aggregate price level. Again, the economy is self-correcting in the long run.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p197"><p>To summarize the analysis of how the economy responds to recessionary and inflationary gaps, we can focus on the <strong>output gap,</strong> the percentage difference between actual aggregate output and potential output.

The verdict of most, though not all, macroeconomists is that recessions are mainly caused by demand shocks. But when a negative supply shock does happen, the resulting recession tends to be particularly severe.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p204"><p>Let’s get specific. Officially there have been twelve recessions in the United States since World War II. However, two of these, in 1979–1980 and 1981–1982, are often treated as a single “double-dip” recession, bringing the total number down to eleven. Of these eleven recessions, only two—the recession of 1973–1975 and the double-dip recession of 1979–1982—showed the distinctive combination of falling aggregate output and a surge in the price level that we call stagflation. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_464"><p>464</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p205"><p>In each case, the cause of the supply shock was political turmoil in the Middle East—the Arab–Israeli war of 1973 and the Iranian revolution of 1979—that disrupted world oil supplies and sent oil prices skyrocketing. In fact, economists sometimes refer to the two slumps as “OPEC I” and “OPEC II,” after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the world oil cartel. A third recession that began in 2007 and lasted until 2009 was at least partially exacerbated, if not at least partially caused, by a spike in oil prices.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p206"><p>So eight of eleven postwar recessions were purely the result of demand shocks, not supply shocks. The few supply-shock recessions, however, were the worst as measured by the unemployment rate. <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-19">Figure 16-15</span> shows the U.S. unemployment rate since 1948, with the dates of the 1973 Arab–Israeli war and the 1979 Iranian revolution marked on the graph. Some of the highest unemployment rates since World War II came after these big negative supply shocks.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p207"><p>There’s a reason the aftermath of a supply shock tends to be particularly severe for the economy: macroeconomic policy has a much harder time dealing with supply shocks than with demand shocks. Indeed, the reason the Federal Reserve was having a hard time in 2008, as described in the opening story, was the fact that in early 2008 the U.S. economy was in a recession partially caused by a supply shock (although it was also facing a demand shock). Next we’ll see why supply shocks present such a problem. </p></div>
