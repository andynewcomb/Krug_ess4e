<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p167"><p>Through its expansionary and contractionary effects, monetary policy is generally the policy tool of choice to help stabilize the economy. However, not all actions by central banks are productive. In particular, central banks sometimes print money not to fight a recessionary gap but to help the government pay its bills, an action that typically destabilizes the economy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p168"><p>What happens when a change in the money supply pushes the economy away from, rather than toward, long-run equilibrium? In <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch16_1.html">Chapter 16</span> we learned that the economy is self-correcting in the long run: a demand shock has only a temporary effect on aggregate output. If the demand shock is the result of a change in the money supply, we can make a stronger statement: in the long run, changes in the quantity of money affect the aggregate price level, but they do not change real aggregate output or the interest rate. To see why, let’s look at what happens if the central bank permanently increases the money supply.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p169"><p>To analyze the long-run effects of monetary policy, it’s helpful to think of the central bank as choosing a target for the money supply rather than the interest rate.

<span data-type="number">Figure 19.11: </span><span data-type="caption">When the economy is already at potential output, an increase in the money supply generates a positive short-run effect, but no long-run effect, on real GDP. Here, the economy begins at <em>E</em><sub>1</sub>, a point of short-run and long-run macroeconomic equilibrium. An increase in the money supply shifts the <em>AD</em> curve rightward, and the economy moves to a new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium at <em>E</em><sub>2</sub> and a new real GDP of <em>Y</em><sub>2</sub>. But <em>E</em><sub>2</sub> is not a long-run equilibrium: <em>Y</em><sub>2</sub> exceeds potential output, <em>Y</em><sub>1</sub>, leading over time to an increase in nominal wages. In the long run, the increase in nominal wages shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve leftward, to a new position at <em>SRAS</em><sub>2</sub>. The economy reaches a new short-run and long-run macroeconomic equilibrium at <em>E</em><sub>3</sub> on the <em>LRAS</em> curve, and output falls back to potential output, <em>Y</em><sub>1</sub>. When the economy is already at potential output, the only long-run effect of an increase in the money supply is an increase in the aggregate price level from <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>P</em><sub>3</sub>.</span>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p171"><p>Now suppose there is an increase in the money supply. Other things equal, an increase in the money supply reduces the interest rate, which increases investment spending, which leads to a further rise in consumer spending, and so on. So an increase in the money supply increases the quantity of goods and services demanded, shifting the <em>AD</em> curve rightward, to <em>AD</em><sub>2</sub>. In the short run, the economy moves to a new short-run macroeconomic equilibrium at <em>E</em><sub>2</sub>. The price level rises from <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>P</em><sub>2</sub>, and real GDP rises from <em>Y</em><sub>1</sub> to 
<em>Y</em><sub>2</sub>. That is, both the aggregate price level and aggregate output increase in the short run.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p172"><p>But the aggregate output level, <em>Y</em><sub>2</sub>, is above potential output. As a result, nominal wages will rise over time, causing the short-run aggregate supply curve to shift leftward. This process stops only when the <em>SRAS</em> curve ends up at <em>SRAS</em><sub>2</sub> and the economy ends up at point <em>E</em><sub>3</sub>, a point of both short-run and long-run macroeconomic equilibrium. The long-run effect of an increase in the money supply, then, is that the aggregate price level has increased from <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>P</em><sub>3</sub>, but aggregate output is back at potential output, <em>Y</em><sub>1</sub>. In the long run, a monetary expansion raises the aggregate price level but has no effect on real GDP.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p173"><p>We won’t describe the effects of a monetary contraction in detail, but the same logic applies. In the short run, a fall in the money supply leads to a fall in aggregate output as the economy moves down the short-run aggregate supply curve. In the long run, however, the monetary contraction reduces only the aggregate price level, and real GDP returns to potential output.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p174"><p>How much does a change in the money supply change the aggregate price level in the long run? The answer is that a change in the money supply leads to an equal proportional change in the aggregate price level in the long run. If the money supply falls 25%, the aggregate price level falls 25% in the long run; if the money supply rises 50%, the aggregate price level rises 50% in the long run.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p175"><p>How do we know this? Consider the following thought experiment: suppose all prices in the economy—prices of final goods and services and also factor prices, such as nominal wage rates—double. And suppose the money supply doubles at the same time. What difference does this make to the economy in real terms? The answer is none. All real variables in the economy—such as real GDP and the real value of the money supply (the amount of goods and services it can buy)—are unchanged. So there is no reason for anyone to behave any differently.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p176"><p>We can state this argument in reverse: if the economy starts out in long-run macroeconomic equilibrium and the money supply changes, restoring long-run macroeconomic equilibrium requires restoring all real values to their original values. This includes restoring the real value of the money supply to its original level. So if the money supply falls 25%, the aggregate price level must fall 25%; if the money supply rises 50%, the price level must rise 50%; and so on.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p178"><p>This analysis demonstrates the concept known as <strong>monetary neutrality,</strong> in which changes in the money supply have no real effects on the economy. In the long run, the only effect of an increase in the money supply is to raise the aggregate price level by an equal percentage. Economists argue that <em>money is neutral in the long run.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p179"><p>This is, however, a good time to recall the dictum of John Maynard Keynes: “In the long run we are all dead.” In the long run, changes in the money supply don’t have any effect on real GDP, interest rates, or anything else except the price level. But it would be foolish to 
conclude from this that the Fed is irrelevant. Monetary policy has powerful real effects on the economy in the short run, often making the difference between recession and expansion. And that matters a lot for society’s welfare.</p></div>

First, due to monetary neutrality, in the long run the aggregate price level rises by the same proportion as the money supply; so if the money supply rises by, say, 50%, the price level will also rise by 50%. Second, the demand for money is, other things equal, proportional to the aggregate price level.</p></div>

Each major nation (or, in the case of the euro, the euro area) has a central bank that is insulated from political pressure. All of these central banks try to keep the aggregate price level roughly stable, which usually means inflation of at most 2% to 3% per year.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p188"><p>But if we look at a longer period and a wider group of countries, we see large differences in the growth of the money supply. Between 1970 and the present, the money supply rose only a few percent per year in some countries, such as Switzerland and the United States, but rose much more rapidly in some poorer countries, such as South Africa. These differences allow us to see whether it is true that increases in the money supply lead, in the long run, to equal percent rises in the aggregate price level.</p></div>
