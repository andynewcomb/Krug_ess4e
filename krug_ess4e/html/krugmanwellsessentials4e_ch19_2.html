</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p21"><p>Most economic decisions involve trade-offs at the margin. That is, individuals decide how much of a good to consume by determining whether the benefit they’d gain from consuming a bit more of any given good is worth the cost. The same decision process is used when deciding how much money to hold.</p></div>

<div data-type="figure_text"><span data-type="caption">There is a price to be paid for the convenience of holding money.</span></div>
<div data-type="asset_source">Big Cheese Photo/SuperStock</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p22"><p>Individuals and firms find it useful to hold some of their assets in the form of money because of the convenience money provides: money can be used to make purchases directly, but other assets can’t. But there is a price to be paid for that convenience: money normally yields a lower rate of return than nonmonetary assets.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p23"><p>As an example of how convenience makes it worth incurring some opportunity costs, consider the fact that even today—with the prevalence of credit cards, debit cards, and ATMs—people continue to keep cash in their wallets rather than leave the funds in an interest-bearing account. They do this to avoid going to an ATM to withdraw money every time they want to buy lunch from a place that doesn’t accept credit cards or won’t accept them for small amounts because of the processing fee. In other words, the convenience of keeping some cash in your wallet is more valuable than the interest you would earn by keeping that money in the bank.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p24"><p>Even holding money in a checking account involves a trade-off between convenience and earning interest. That’s because you can earn a higher interest rate by putting your money in assets other than a checking account. For example, many banks offer certificates of deposit, or CDs, which pay a higher interest rate than ordinary bank accounts. But CDs also carry a penalty if you withdraw the funds before a certain amount of time—say, six months—has elapsed. An individual who keeps funds in a checking account is forgoing the higher interest rate those funds would have earned if placed in a CD in return for the convenience of having cash readily available when needed.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p25"><p>So making sense of the demand for money is about understanding how individuals and firms trade off the benefit of holding cash—that provides convenience but no interest—versus the benefit of holding interest-bearing nonmonetary assets—that provide interest but not convenience. And that trade-off is affected by the interest rate. (As before, when we say <em>the interest rate</em> it is with the understanding that we mean a nominal interest rate—that is, it’s unadjusted for inflation.) Next, we’ll examine how that trade-off changed dramatically from June 2007 to June 2008, when there was a big fall in interest rates.</p></div>

The first row shows the interest rate on one-month certificates of deposit—that is, the interest rate individuals could get if they were willing to tie their funds up for one month. In June 2007, one-month CDs yielded 5.30%. The second row shows the interest rate on interest-bearing demand deposits (specifically, those included in M2, minus small time deposits). Funds in these accounts were more accessible than those in CDs, but the price of that convenience was a much lower interest rate, only 2.30%. Finally, the last row shows the interest rate on currency—cash in your wallet—which was, of course, zero.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p32"><p>As short-term interest rates fell between June 2007 and June 2008, the interest rates on money didn’t fall by the same amount. The interest rate on currency, of course, remained at zero. The interest rate paid on demand deposits did fall, but by much less than short-term interest rates. As a comparison of the two columns of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch19/table_19_2.html">Table 19-2</span> shows, the opportunity cost of holding money fell. The last two rows of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch19/table_19_2.html">Table 19-2</span> summarize this comparison: they give the differences between the interest rates on demand deposits and on currency and the interest rate on CDs.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p33"><p>These differences—the opportunity cost of holding money rather than interest-bearing assets—declined sharply between June 2007 and June 2008. This reflects a general result: <em>the higher the short-term interest rate, the higher the opportunity cost of holding money; the lower the short-term interest rate, the lower the opportunity cost of holding money.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p34"><p>The fact that the federal funds rate in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch19/table_19_2.html">Table 19-2</span> and the interest rate on one-month CDs fell by almost the same percentage is not an accident: all short-term interest rates tend to move together, with rare exceptions because CDs and other short-term assets (like one-month and three-month U.S. Treasury bills) are in effect competing for the same business. Any short-term asset that offers a lower-than-average interest rate will be sold by investors, who will move their wealth into a higher-yielding short-term asset. The selling of the asset, in turn, forces its interest rate up, because investors must be rewarded with a higher rate in order to induce them to buy it.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p35"><p>Conversely, investors will move their wealth into any short-term financial asset that offers an above-average interest rate. The purchase of the asset drives its interest rate down when sellers find they can lower the rate of return on the asset and still find willing buyers. So interest rates on short-term financial assets tend to be roughly the same because no asset will consistently offer a higher-than-average or a lower-than-average interest rate.</p></div>

The difference between short-term and long-term interest rates is sometimes important as a practical matter.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p38"><p>Moreover, it’s short-term rates rather than long-term rates that affect money demand, because the decision to hold money involves trading off the convenience of holding cash versus the payoff from holding assets that mature in the short term—a year or less. For the moment, however, let’s ignore the distinction between short-term and long-term rates and assume that there is only one interest rate.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p41"><p>The relationship between the interest rate and the quantity of money demanded by the public is illustrated by the <strong>money demand curve,</strong> <em>MD</em>, in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch19/KrugESS4e_fig_19_01.html">Figure 19-1</span>. The money demand curve slopes downward because, other things equal, a higher interest rate increases the opportunity cost of holding money, leading the public to reduce the quantity of money it demands. For example, if the interest rate is very low—say, 1%—the interest forgone by holding money is relatively small. As a result, individuals and firms will tend to hold relatively large amounts of money to avoid the cost and nuisance of converting other assets into money when making purchases.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p42"><p>By contrast, if the interest rate is relatively high—say, 15%, a level it reached in the United States in the early 1980s—the opportunity cost of holding money is high. People will respond by keeping only small amounts in cash and deposits, converting assets into money only when needed.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p43"><p>You might ask why we draw the money demand curve with the interest rate—as opposed to rates of return on other assets, such as stocks or real estate—on the vertical axis. The answer is that for most people the relevant question in deciding how much money to hold is whether to put the funds in the form of other assets that can be turned fairly quickly and easily into money. Stocks don’t fit that definition because there are significant transaction fees when you sell stock (which is why stock market investors are advised not to buy and sell too often). Real estate doesn’t fit the definition either because selling real estate involves even larger fees and can take a long time as well. So the relevant comparison is with assets that are “close to” money—fairly liquid assets like CDs. And as we’ve already seen, the interest rates on all these assets normally move closely together.</p></div>

A decrease in money demand shifts the money demand curve to the left, from <em>MD</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>MD</em><sub>3</sub>, and the quantity of money demanded falls at any given interest rate.</span>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p45"><p>The most important factors causing the money demand curve to shift are changes in the aggregate price level, changes in real GDP, changes in credit markets and banking technology, and changes in institutions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p46"><p><span data-block_type="h3-ri"><strong>Changes in the Aggregate Price Level</strong></span> Americans keep a lot more cash in their wallets and funds in their checking accounts today than they did in the 1950s. One reason is that they have to if they want to be able to buy anything: almost everything costs more now than it did when you could get a burger, fries, and a drink at McDonald’s for 45 cents and a gallon of gasoline for 29 cents. So, other things equal, higher prices increase the demand for money (a rightward shift of the <em>MD</em> curve), and lower prices decrease the demand for money (a leftward shift of the <em>MD</em> curve).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p47"><p>We can actually be more specific than this: other things equal, the demand for money is <em>proportional</em> to the price level. That is, if the aggregate price level rises by 20%, the quantity of money demanded at any given interest rate, such as <em>r</em><sub>1</sub> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch19/KrugESS4e_fig_19_02.html">Figure 19-2</span>, also rises by 20%—the movement from <em>M</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>M</em><sub>2</sub>. Why? Because if the price of everything rises by 20%, it takes 20% more money to buy the same basket of goods and services. And if the aggregate price level falls by 20%, at any given interest rate the quantity of money demanded falls by 20%—shown by the movement from <em>M</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>M</em><sub>3</sub> at the interest rate <em>r</em><sub>1</sub>. As we’ll see, the fact that money demand is proportional to the price level has important implications for the long-run effects of monetary policy.</p></div>

The invention of revolving-balance credit cards allowed people to hold less money in order to fund their purchases and decreased the demand for money. In addition, changes in banking technology that made credit cards widely available and widely accepted magnified the effect, making it easier for people to make purchases without having to convert funds from their interest-bearing assets, further reducing the demand for money.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p50"><p><span data-block_type="h3-ri"><strong>Changes in Institutions</strong></span> Changes in institutions can increase or decrease the demand for money. For example, until Regulation Q was eliminated in 1980, U.S. banks weren’t allowed to offer interest on checking accounts. So the interest you would forgo by holding funds in a checking account instead of an interest-bearing asset made the opportunity cost of holding funds in checking accounts very high. When banking regulations changed, allowing banks to pay interest on checking account funds, the demand for money rose and shifted the money demand curve to the right.</p></div>

Yet Japan is one of the most economically and technologically advanced countries, and superior to the United States in some areas such as transportation. So why do the citizens of this economic powerhouse still do business the way Americans and Europeans did a generation ago? The answer highlights the factors affecting the demand for money.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p54"><p>One reason the Japanese use cash so much is that their institutions never made the switch to heavy reliance on plastic. For complex reasons, Japan’s retail sector is still dominated by small mom-and-pop stores, which are reluctant to invest in credit card technology. Japan’s banks have also been slow about pushing transaction technology; visitors are often surprised to find that ATMs outside of major metropolitan areas close early in the evening rather than staying open all night.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p55"><p>But there’s another reason the Japanese hold so much cash: there’s little opportunity cost to doing so. Short-term interest rates in Japan have been below 1% since the mid-1990s. It also helps that the Japanese crime rate is quite low, so you are unlikely to have your wallet stolen. So why not hold cash?</p></div>
