The quantity of output a firm produces depends on the quantity of inputs; this relationship is known as the firm’s <strong>production function.</strong> As we’ll see, a firm’s production function underlies its <em>cost curves</em>.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p18"><p>To understand the concept of a production function, let’s consider a farm that we assume, for the sake of simplicity, produces only one output, wheat, and uses only two inputs, land and labor. This particular farm is owned by a couple named George and Martha. They hire workers to do the actual physical labor on the farm. Moreover, we will assume that all potential workers are of the same quality—they are all equally knowledgeable and capable of performing farmwork.</p></div>

Land here is what economists call a <strong>fixed input—</strong>an input whose quantity is fixed for a period of time and cannot be varied.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p24"><p>In reality, whether or not the quantity of an input is really fixed depends on the time horizon. In the <strong>long run—</strong>that is, given that a long enough period of time has elapsed—firms can adjust the quantity of any input. For example, in the long run, George and Martha can vary the amount of land they farm by buying or selling land. So there are no fixed inputs in the long run. In contrast, the <strong>short run</strong> is defined as the time period during which at least one input is fixed. Later in this chapter, we’ll look more carefully at the distinction between the short run and the long run. But for now, we will restrict our attention to the short run and assume that at least one input is fixed.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p25"><p>George and Martha know that the quantity of wheat they produce depends on the number of workers they hire. Using modern farming techniques, one worker can cultivate the 10-acre farm, albeit not very intensively. When an additional worker is added, the land is divided equally among all the workers: each worker has 5 acres to cultivate when 2 workers are employed, each cultivates 3⅓ acres when 3 are employed, and so on. So as additional workers are employed, the 10 acres of land are cultivated more intensively and more bushels of wheat are produced.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p35"><p>Now we can explain the significance of the slope of the total product curve: it is equal to the marginal product of labor. The slope of a line is equal to “rise” over “run” (see the appendix to <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch2_1.html">Chapter 2</span>). This implies that the slope of the total product curve is the change in the quantity of output (the “rise”, Δ<em>Q</em>) divided by the change in the quantity of labor (the “run”, Δ<em>L</em>). And this, as we can see from Equation 6-1, is simply the marginal product of labor. So in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/KrugESS4e_fig_6_01.html">Figure 6-1</span>, the fact that the marginal product of the first worker is 19 also means that the slope of the total product curve in going from 0 to 1 worker is 19. Similarly, the slope of the total product curve in going from 1 to 2 workers is the same as the marginal product of the second worker, 17, and so on.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx4-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p37"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">W</span>heat yields differ substantially around the world. The disparity between France and the United States that you see in this graph is particularly striking, given that they are both wealthy countries with comparable agricultural technology. Yet the reason for that disparity is straightforward: differing government policies. In the United States, farmers receive payments from the government to supplement their incomes, but European farmers benefit from price floors. Since European farmers get higher prices for their output than American farmers, they employ more variable inputs and produce significantly higher yields.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p38"><p>Interestingly, in poor countries like Uganda and Ethiopia, foreign aid can lead to significantly depressed yields. Foreign aid from wealthy countries has often taken the form of surplus food, which depresses local market prices, severely hurting the local agriculture that poor countries normally depend on. Charitable organizations like OXFAM have asked wealthy food-producing countries to modify their aid policies—principally, to give aid in cash rather than in food products except in the case of acute food shortages—to avoid this problem.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p43"><p>In this example the marginal product of labor falls as the number of workers increases. That is, there are <em>diminishing returns to labor</em> on George and Martha’s farm. In general, there are <strong>diminishing returns to an input</strong> when an increase in the quantity of that input, holding the quantity of all other inputs fixed, reduces that input’s marginal product. Due to diminishing returns to labor, the <em>MPL</em> curve is negatively sloped.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p44"><p>To grasp why diminishing returns can occur, think about what happens as George and Martha add more and more workers without increasing the number of acres of land. As the number of workers increases, the land is farmed more intensively and the number of bushels produced increases. But each additional worker is working with a smaller share of the 10 acres—the fixed input—than the previous worker. As a result, the additional worker cannot produce as much output as the previous worker. So it’s not surprising that the marginal product of the additional worker falls.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p45"><p>The crucial point to emphasize about diminishing returns is that, like many propositions in economics, it is an “other things equal” proposition: each successive unit of an input will raise production by less than the last <em>if the quantity of all other inputs is held fixed.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p48"><p>The marginal product of labor (or any other input) is defined as the increase in the quantity of output when you increase the quantity of that input by one unit. But what do we mean by a “unit” of labor? Is it an additional hour of labor, an additional week, or a person-year?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p49"><p>The answer is that it doesn’t matter, <em>as long as you are consistent.</em> One common source of error in economics is getting units confused—say, comparing the output added by an additional <em>hour</em> of labor with the cost of employing a worker for a <em>week.</em> Whatever units you use, always be careful that you use the same units throughout your analysis of any problem.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p54"><p>To translate information about a firm’s production function into information about its costs, we need to know how much the firm must pay for its inputs. We will assume that George and Martha face a cost of $400 for the use of the land. It is irrelevant whether George and Martha must rent 10 acres of the land for $400 from someone else or whether they own the land themselves and forgo earning $400 from renting it to someone else. Either way, they pay an opportunity cost of $400 by using the land to grow wheat. Moreover, since the land is a fixed input, the $400 George and Martha pay for it is a <strong>fixed cost,</strong> denoted by <em>FC</em>—a cost that does not depend on the quantity of output produced (in the short run). In business, fixed cost is often referred to as “overhead cost.”</p></div>

Using their production function, George and Martha know that the number of workers they must hire depends on the amount of wheat they intend to produce. So the cost of labor, which is equal to the number of workers multiplied by $200, is a <strong>variable cost,</strong> denoted by <em>VC</em>—a cost that depends on the quantity of output produced. It is variable because in order to produce more they have to employ more units of input. Adding the fixed cost and the variable cost of a given quantity of output gives the <strong>total cost,</strong> or <em>TC,</em> of that quantity of output. We can express the relationship among fixed cost, variable cost, and total cost as an equation:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p64"><p>George and Martha’s total cost curve is shown in the diagram in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/KrugESS4e_fig_6_04.html">Figure 6-4</span>, where the horizontal axis measures the quantity of output in bushels of wheat and the vertical axis measures total cost in dollars. Each point on the curve corresponds to one row of the table in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/KrugESS4e_fig_6_04.html">Figure 6-4</span>. For example, point <em>A</em> shows the situation when 0 workers are employed: output is 0, and total cost is equal to fixed cost, $400. Similarly, point <em>B</em> shows the situation when 1 worker is employed: output is 19 bushels, and total cost is $600, equal to the sum of $400 in fixed cost and $200 in variable cost.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p65"><p>Like the total product curve, the total cost curve slopes upward: due to the variable cost, the more output produced, the higher the farm’s total cost. But unlike the total product curve, which gets flatter as employment rises, the total cost curve gets <em>steeper.</em> That is, the slope of the total cost curve is greater as the amount of output produced increases. As we will soon see, the steepening of the total cost curve is also due to diminishing returns to the variable input. Before we can understand this, we must first look at the relationships among several useful measures of cost.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p68"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">T</span>he concept of diminishing returns to an input was first formulated by economists during the late eighteenth century. These economists, notably including Thomas Malthus, drew their inspiration from agricultural examples.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p69"><p>However, the idea of diminishing returns to an input applies with equal force to the most modern of economic activities—such as, say, the design of software. In 1975 Frederick P. Brooks Jr., a project manager at IBM during the days when it dominated the computer business, published a book titled <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> that soon became a classic—so much so that a special anniversary edition was published 20 years later.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p70"><p>The chapter that gave its title to the book is basically about diminishing returns to labor in the writing of software. Brooks observed that multiplying the number of programmers assigned to a project did not produce a proportionate reduction in the time it took to get the program written. A project that could be done by 1 programmer in 12 months could <em>not</em> be done by 12 programmers in 1 month—hence the “mythical man-month,” the false notion that the number of lines of programming code produced was proportional to the number of code writers employed. In fact, above a certain number, adding another programmer on a project actually <em>increased</em> the time to completion.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p71"><p>The argument of <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> is summarized in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/KrugESS4e_fig_6_05.html">Figure 6-5</span>. The upper part of the figure shows how the quantity of the project’s output, as measured by the number of lines of code produced per month, varies with the number of programmers. Each additional programmer accomplishes less than the previous one, and beyond a certain point an additional programmer is actually counterproductive. The lower part of the figure shows the marginal product of each successive programmer, which falls as more programmers are employed and eventually becomes negative.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p72"><p>In other words, programming is subject to diminishing returns so severe that at some point more programmers actually have negative marginal product. The source of the diminishing returns lies in the nature of the production function for a programming project: each programmer must coordinate his or her work with that of all the other programmers on the project, leading each person to spend more time communicating with others as the number of programmers increases. In other words, other things equal, there are diminishing returns to labor. It is likely, however, that if fixed inputs devoted to programming projects are increased—say, installing a faster and more accurate programming bug-detection system—the problem of diminishing returns for additional programmers can be mitigated.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p73"><p>A reviewer of the reissued edition of <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> summarized the reasons for these diminishing returns: “There is an inescapable overhead to yoking up programmers in parallel. The members of the team must ‘waste time’ attending meetings, drafting project plans, exchanging e-mail, negotiating interfaces, enduring performance reviews, and so on…. At Microsoft, there will be at least one team member that just designs T-shirts for the rest of the team to wear.”</p></div>
