What kind of stuff? All kinds. Residents of the United States (including firms operating in the United States) sold airplanes, bonds, wheat, and many other items to residents of other countries. Residents of the United States bought cars, stocks, oil, and many other items from residents of other countries.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p203"><p>Row 1 of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch20/table_20_4.html">Table 20-4</span> shows payments that arise from U.S. sales to foreigners and U.S. purchases from foreigners of goods and services in 2013. For example, the number in the second column of row 1, $2,280 billion, incorporates items such as the value of U.S. wheat exports and the fees foreigners pay to U.S. consulting companies in 2013. The number in the third column of row 1, $2,756 billion, incorporates items such as the value of U.S. oil imports and the fees U.S. companies pay to Indian call centers—the people who often answer your 1-800 calls—in 2013.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p204"><p>Row 2 shows U.S. <em>factor income</em> in 2013—the income that foreigners paid to American residents for the use of American-owned factors of production, as well as income paid by Americans to foreigners for the use of foreign-owned factors of production. Factor income mostly consists of investment income, such as interest paid by Americans on loans from overseas, profits of American-owned corporations that operate overseas, and the like. For example, the profits earned by Disneyland Paris, which is owned by the U.S.-based Walt Disney Company, are included in the $780 billion figure in the second column of row 2. The profits earned by the U.S. operations of Japanese auto companies are included in the $580 billion figure shown in the third column of row 2. Factor income also includes some labor income. For example, the wages of an American engineer who works temporarily on a construction site in Dubai are counted in the $780 billion figure in the second column.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p205"><p>Row 3 shows <em>international transfers</em> for the U.S. in 2013—funds sent by American residents to residents of other countries and vice versa. The figure in the second column of row 3, $118 billion, includes payments sent home by skilled American workers who work abroad. The third column accounts for the major portion of international transfers. The figure there, $242 billion, is composed mainly of remittances that immigrants who reside in the United States, such as the millions of Mexican-born workers employed in the United States, send to their families in their country of origin. In addition there is also a lot of money sent home by U.S. skilled workers abroad.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p206"><p>Row 4 of the table contains payments accruing from sales and purchases of assets between American residents and foreigners in 2013. For example, in 2013 Shanghui, a Chinese food company, purchased Smithfield Foods, America’s top pork packager, for $4.7 billion. As a payment to the American owners of Smithfield Foods for the purchase of their assets, that $4.7 billion is included in the figure $1,018 billion, found in the second column of row 4. Also in 2013, some major Wall Street firms were buying European debt, both private and public. As a payment by American residents to foreigners for the purchase of foreign assets, these purchases are included in the −$645 billion figure located in the third column of row 4.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p207"><p>In laying out <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch20/table_20_4.html">Table 20-4</span>, we have separated rows 1, 2, and 3 into one group, to distinguish them from row 4. This reflects a fundamental difference in how these two groups of transactions affect the future. When a U.S. resident sells a good such as wheat to a foreigner, that’s the end of the transaction. But a financial asset, such as a bond, is different. Remember, a bond is a promise to pay interest and principal in the future. So when a U.S. resident sells a bond to a foreigner, that sale creates a liability: the U.S. resident will have to pay interest and repay principal in the future. The balance of payments accounts distinguish between transactions that don’t create liabilities and those that do.</p></div>

Simultaneously, it ran a financial account surplus: the value of the assets it sold to foreigners was more than the value of the assets it bought from foreigners.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p217"><p>In the 2013 official data, the U.S. current account deficit and financial account surplus didn’t exactly offset each other: the financial account surplus in 2013 was $27 billion smaller than the current account deficit.

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p229"><p>International differences in the demand for funds reflect underlying differences in investment opportunities. In particular, a country with a rapidly growing economy, other things equal, tends to offer more investment opportunities than a country with a slowly growing economy. So a rapidly growing economy typically—though not always—has a higher demand for capital and offers higher returns to investors than a slowly growing economy. As a result, capital tends to flow from slowly growing to rapidly growing economies.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p230"><p>The classic example, described in the upcoming Economics in Action, is the flow of capital from Britain to the United States, among other countries, between 1870 and 1914. During that era, the U.S. economy was growing rapidly as the population increased and spread westward and as the nation industrialized, creating a demand for investment spending on railroads, factories, and so on. Meanwhile, Britain had a much more slowly growing population, was already industrialized, and already had a railroad network covering the country. This left Britain with savings to spare, much of which were lent out to the United States and other New World economies.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx4-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p232"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">T</span>he United States generally runs a large deficit in its current account. In fact, America leads the world in its current account deficit; other countries run bigger deficits as a share of GDP, but they have much smaller economies, so the U.S. deficit is much bigger in absolute terms.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p233"><p>For the world as a whole, however, deficits on the part of some countries must be matched with surpluses on the part of other countries. So who are the surplus nations offsetting U.S. deficits, and what if anything do they have in common?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p234"><p>The figure shows the average current account surplus of the six countries that ran the largest surpluses over the period from 2000 to 2013. China tops the list with a surplus that was largely due to its policy of keeping its currency weak relative to other currencies.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p235"><p>Japan and Germany run current account surpluses for more or less the same reasons: both are rich nations with high savings rates, giving them a lot of money to invest. Since some of that money goes abroad, the result is that they run deficits on the financial account and surpluses on current account.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p236"><p>The other three countries are all major oil exporters. (You may not think of Russia or Norway as “petro-economies,” but Russia derives about two-thirds of its export revenue from oil, and Norway owns huge oil fields in the North Sea.) These countries are all deliberately building up assets abroad to help them sustain their spending when the oil runs out.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p237"><p>All in all, the surplus countries are a diverse group. If your picture of the world is simply one of American deficits versus Chinese surpluses, you’re missing a large part of the story.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p239"><p>International differences in the supply of funds reflect differences in savings across countries. These may be the result of differences in private savings rates, which vary widely among countries. For example, in 2014 gross private savings were 27% of Germany’s GDP but only 17% of U.S. GDP. They may also reflect differences in savings by governments. In particular, government budget deficits, which reduce overall national savings, can lead to capital inflows.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p240"><p>International investment opportunities and differences in savings rates are important determinants of the direction of <em>net</em> capital flows—the excess of inflows into a country over outflows, or vice versa. The direction of net flows, other things equal, is determined by differences in interest rates between countries. As we saw in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch20/table_20_4.html">Table 20-4</span>, however, <em>gross</em> flows take place in both directions: for example, the United States both sells assets to foreigners and buys assets from foreigners. Why does capital move in both directions?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p241"><p>The answer to this question is that in the real world, as opposed to the simple model we’ve just learned, there are other motives for international capital flows besides seeking a higher rate of interest.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p242"><p>Individual investors often seek to diversify against risk by buying stocks in a number of countries. Stocks in Europe may do well when stocks in the United States do badly, or vice versa, so investors in Europe try to reduce their risk by buying some U.S. stocks, as investors in the United States try to reduce their risk by buying some European stocks. The result is capital flows in both directions.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p243"><p>Meanwhile, corporations often engage in international investment as part of their business strategy—for example, auto companies may find that they can compete better in a national market if they assemble some of their cars locally. Such business investments can also lead to two-way capital flows, as, say, European car makers build plants in the United States even as U.S. computer companies open facilities in Europe. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p244"><p>Finally, some countries, including the United States, are international banking centers: people from all over the world put money in U.S. financial institutions, which then invest many of those funds overseas.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p245"><p>The result of these two-way flows is that modern economies are typically both debtors (countries that owe money to the rest of the world) and creditors (countries to which the rest of the world owes money). Due to years of both capital inflows and outflows, at the end of 2015, the United States had accumulated foreign assets worth $23.2 trillion, and foreigners had accumulated assets in the United States worth $30.6 trillion.</p></div>

Jet planes have put most of the world’s cities within a few hours of one another; modern telecommunications transmit information instantly around the globe. So you might think that international capital flows must now be larger than ever.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p249"><p>But if capital flows are measured as a share of world savings and investment, that belief turns out not to be true. The golden age of capital flows actually preceded World War I—from 1870 to 1914.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p250"><p>These capital flows went mainly from European countries, especially Britain, to what were then known as <em>zones of recent settlement,</em> countries that were attracting large numbers of European immigrants. Among the big recipients of capital inflows were Australia, Argentina, Canada, and the United States.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p251"><p>The large capital flows reflected differences in investment opportunities. Britain, a mature industrial economy with limited natural resources and a slowly growing population, offered relatively limited opportunities for new investment. The zones of recent settlement, with rapidly growing populations and abundant natural resources, offered investors a higher return and attracted capital inflows. Estimates suggest that over this period Britain sent about 40% of its savings abroad, largely to finance railroads and other large projects. No country has matched that record in modern times.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p252"><p>Why can’t we match the capital flows of our great-great-grandfathers? Economists aren’t completely sure, but they have pointed to two causes: migration restrictions and political risks.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p253"><p>During the golden age of capital flows, capital movements were complementary to population movements: the big recipients of capital from Europe were also places to which large numbers of Europeans were moving. These large-scale population movements were possible before World War I because there were few legal restrictions on immigration. Today, by contrast, migration is limited by extensive legal barriers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p254"><p>The other factor that has changed is political risk. Modern governments often limit foreign investment because they fear it will diminish their national autonomy. And due to political or security concerns, governments sometimes seize foreign property, a risk that deters investors from sending more than a relatively modest share of their wealth abroad. In the nineteenth century such actions were rare, partly because some major destinations of investment were still European colonies, partly because in those days governments had a habit of sending troops and gunboats to enforce the claims of their investors.</p></div>
