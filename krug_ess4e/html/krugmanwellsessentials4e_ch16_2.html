<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p23"><p>The Great Depression, the great majority of economists agree, was the result of a massive negative demand shock. What does that mean? In <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch3_1.html">Chapter 3</span> we explained that when economists talk about a fall in the demand for a particular good or service, they’re referring to a leftward shift of the demand curve. Similarly, when economists talk about a negative demand shock to the economy as a whole, they’re referring to a leftward shift of the <strong>aggregate demand curve,</strong> a curve that shows the relationship between the aggregate price level and the quantity of aggregate output demanded by households, firms, the government, and the rest of the world.</p></div>

The horizontal axis shows the total quantity of domestic goods and services demanded, measured in 2009 dollars. We use real GDP to measure aggregate output and will often use the two terms interchangeably. The vertical axis shows the aggregate price level, measured by the GDP deflator. With these variables on the axes, we can draw a curve, <em>AD,</em> showing how much aggregate output would have been demanded at any given aggregate price level. Since <em>AD</em> is meant to illustrate aggregate demand in 1933, one point on the curve corresponds to actual data for 1933, when the aggregate price level was 7.3 and the total quantity of domestic final goods and services purchased was $778 billion in 2009 dollars.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p27"><p>In <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-2">Figure 16-1</span>, the curve <em>AD</em> is downward sloping. To understand why, you’ll need to learn the basic equation of national income accounting:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p28"><p><strong>(16-1)</strong> GDP = <em>C</em> + <em>I</em> + <em>G</em> + <em>X</em> − <em>IM</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p29"><p>where <em>C</em> is consumer spending, <em>I</em> is investment spending, <em>G</em> is government purchases of goods and services, <em>X</em> is exports to other countries, and <em>IM</em> is imports. If we measure these variables in constant dollars—that is, in prices of a base year—then <em>C</em> + <em>I</em> + <em>G</em> + <em>X</em> − <em>IM</em> is the quantity of domestically produced final goods and services demanded during a given period. <em>G</em> is decided by the government, but the other variables are private-sector decisions. To understand why the aggregate demand curve slopes downward, we need to understand why a rise in the aggregate price level reduces <em>C, I,</em> and <em>X</em> − <em>IM.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p30"><p>You might think that the downward slope of the aggregate demand curve is a natural consequence of the <em>law of demand</em> we defined back in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch3_1.html">Chapter 3</span>. That is, since the demand curve for any one good is downward sloping, isn’t it natural that the demand curve for aggregate output is also downward sloping? This turns out, however, to be a misleading parallel. The demand curve for any individual good shows how the quantity demanded depends on the price of that good, <em>holding the prices of other goods and services constant.</em> The main reason the quantity of a good demanded falls when the price of that good rises—that is, the quantity of a good demanded falls as we move up the demand curve—is that people switch their consumption to other goods and services.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p31"><p>But when we consider movements up or down the aggregate demand curve, we’re considering <em>a simultaneous change in the prices of all final goods and services.</em> Furthermore, changes in the composition of goods and services in consumer spending aren’t relevant to the aggregate demand curve: if consumers decide to buy fewer clothes but more cars, this doesn’t necessarily change the total quantity of final goods and services they demand.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p32"><p>Why, then, does a rise in the aggregate price level lead to a fall in the quantity of all domestically produced final goods and services demanded? There are two main reasons: the <em>wealth effect</em> and the <em>interest rate effect</em> of a change in the aggregate price level.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p33"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>The Wealth Effect</strong></span> An increase in the aggregate price level, other things equal, reduces the purchasing power of many assets. Consider, for example, someone who has $5,000 in a bank account. If the aggregate price level were to rise by 25%, what used to cost $5,000 would now cost $6,250, and would no longer be affordable. And what used to cost $4,000 would now cost $5,000, so that the $5,000 in the bank account would now buy only as much as $4,000 would have bought previously. With the loss in purchasing power, the owner of that bank account would probably scale back his or her consumption plans. Millions of other people would respond the same way, leading to a fall in spending on final goods and services, because a rise in the aggregate price level reduces the purchasing power of everyone’s bank account.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p35"><p>Correspondingly, a fall in the aggregate price level increases the purchasing power of consumers’ assets and leads to more consumer demand. The <strong>wealth effect of a change in the aggregate price level</strong> is the effect on consumer spending caused by the effect of a change in the aggregate price level on the purchasing power of consumers’ assets. Because of the wealth effect, consumer spending, <em>C,</em> falls when the aggregate price level rises, leading to a downward-sloping aggregate demand curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p36"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>The Interest Rate Effect</strong></span> Economists use the term <em>money</em> in its narrowest sense to refer to cash and bank deposits on which people can write checks. People and firms hold money because it reduces the cost and inconvenience of making transactions. An increase in the aggregate price level, other things equal, reduces the purchasing power of a given amount of money holdings. To purchase the same basket of goods and services as before, people and firms now need to hold more money. So, in response to an increase in the aggregate price level, the public tries to increase its money holdings, either by borrowing more or by selling assets such as bonds. This reduces the funds available for lending to other borrowers and drives interest rates up.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p38"><p>Earlier we explained that one reason the <em>AD</em> curve is downward sloping is the wealth effect of a change in the aggregate price level: a higher aggregate price level reduces the purchasing power of households’ assets and leads to a fall in consumer spending, <em>C.</em> But we’ve just explained that changes in wealth lead to a shift of the <em>AD</em> curve. Aren’t those two explanations contradictory? Which one is it—does a change in wealth move the economy along the <em>AD</em> curve or does it shift the <em>AD</em> curve? The answer is both: it depends on the <em>source</em> of the change in wealth.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p39"><p>A movement along the <em>AD</em> curve occurs when a change in the aggregate price level changes the purchasing power of consumers’ existing wealth (the real value of their assets). This is the <em>wealth effect of a change in the aggregate price level—</em>a change in the aggregate price level is the source of the change in wealth. For example, a fall in the aggregate price level increases the purchasing power of consumers’ assets and leads to a movement down the <em>AD</em> curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p40"><p>In contrast, a change in wealth <em>independent of a change in the aggregate price level</em> shifts the <em>AD</em> curve. So, a rise in the stock market or in real estate values leads to an increase in the real value of consumers’ assets at any given aggregate price level. In this case, the source of the change in wealth is a change in the values of assets without any change in the aggregate price level—that is, a change in asset values holding the prices of all final goods and services constant.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p42"><p>A rise in the interest rate reduces investment spending because it makes the cost of borrowing higher. It also reduces consumer spending because households save more of their disposable income. So a rise in the aggregate price level depresses investment spending, <em>I,</em> and consumer spending, <em>C,</em> through its effect on the purchasing power of money holdings, an effect known as the <strong>interest rate effect of a change in the aggregate price level.</strong> This also leads to a downward-sloping aggregate demand curve.</p></div>

The same distinction applies to the aggregate demand curve. <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-2">Figure 16-1</span> shows a <em>movement along</em> the aggregate demand curve, a change in the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded as the aggregate price level changes.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p45"><p>But there can also be <em>shifts of</em> the aggregate demand curve, changes in the quantity of goods and services demanded at any given price level, as shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-3">Figure 16-2</span>. When we talk about an increase in aggregate demand, we mean a shift of the aggregate demand curve to the right, as shown in panel (a) by the shift from <em>AD</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>AD</em><sub>2</sub>. A rightward shift occurs when the quantity of aggregate output demanded increases at any given aggregate price level. A decrease in aggregate demand means that the <em>AD</em> curve shifts to the left, as in panel (b). A leftward shift implies that the quantity of aggregate output demanded falls at any given aggregate price level.</p></div>

Consumers base their spending not only on the income they have now but also on the income they expect to have in the future. Firms base their planned investment spending not only on current conditions but also on the sales they expect to make in the future. As a result, changes in expectations can push consumer spending and planned investment spending up or down. If consumers and firms become more optimistic, aggregate spending rises; if they become more pessimistic, aggregate spending falls.</p></div>

And when the real value of household assets falls—for example, because of a stock market crash—the purchasing power they embody is reduced and aggregate demand also falls. The stock market crash of 1929 was a significant factor leading to the Great Depression. Similarly, a sharp decline in real estate values was a major factor depressing consumer spending during the 2007–2009 recession.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p50"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Size of the Existing Stock of Physical Capital</strong></span> Firms engage in planned investment spending to add to their stock of physical capital. Their incentive to spend depends in part on how much physical capital they already have: the more they have, the less they will feel a need to add more, other things equal. The same applies to other types of investment spending—for example, if a large number of houses have been built in recent years, this will depress the demand for new houses and as a result also tend to reduce residential investment spending. In fact, that’s part of the reason for the deep slump in residential investment spending that began in 2006. The housing boom of the previous few years had created an oversupply of houses: by spring 2009, the inventory of unsold houses on the market was equal to more than 14 months of sales, and prices of new homes had fallen more than 25% from their peak. This gave the construction industry little incentive to build even more homes.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p51"><p>One of the key insights of macroeconomics is that the government can have a powerful influence on aggregate demand and that, in some circumstances, this influence can be used to improve economic performance.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p52"><p>The two main ways the government can influence the aggregate demand curve are through fiscal policy and monetary policy. We’ll briefly discuss their influence on aggregate demand, leaving a full-length discussion for upcoming chapters.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p53"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Fiscal Policy</strong></span> As we learned, fiscal policy is the use of either government spending—government purchases of final goods and services and government transfers—or tax policy to stabilize the economy. In practice, governments often respond to recessions by increasing spending, cutting taxes, or both. They often respond to inflation by reducing spending or increasing taxes.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p54"><p>The effect of government purchases of final goods and services, <em>G,</em> on the aggregate demand curve is <em>direct</em> because government purchases are themselves a component of aggregate demand. So an increase in government purchases shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right and a decrease shifts it to the left. History’s most dramatic example of how increased government purchases affect aggregate demand was the effect of wartime government spending during World War II.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p55"><p>Because of the war, U.S. federal purchases surged 400%. This increase in purchases is usually credited with ending the Great Depression. In the 1990s Japan used large public works projects—such as government-financed construction of roads, bridges, and dams—in an effort to increase aggregate demand in the face of a slumping economy. Similarly, in 2009, in the wake of the Great Recession, the United States began spending more than $100 billion on infrastructure projects such as improving highways, bridges, public transportation, and more, to stimulate overall spending.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p56"><p>In contrast, changes in either tax rates or government transfers influence the economy <em>indirectly</em> through their effect on disposable income. A lower tax rate means that consumers get to keep more of what they earn, increasing their disposable income. An increase in government transfers also increases consumers’ disposable income. In either case, this increases consumer spending and shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. A higher tax rate or a reduction in transfers reduces the amount of disposable income received by consumers. This reduces consumer spending and shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p57"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Monetary Policy</strong></span> Earlier we talked about the problems faced by the FOMC, the branch of the Federal Reserve that controls monetary policy—the use of changes in the quantity of money or the interest rate to stabilize the economy. We’ve just discussed how a rise in the aggregate price level, by reducing the purchasing power of money holdings, causes a rise in the interest rate. That, in turn, reduces both investment spending and consumer spending. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p58"><p>But what happens if the quantity of money in the hands of households and firms changes? In modern economies, the quantity of money in circulation is largely determined by the decisions of a <em>central bank</em> created by the government. As we’ll learn in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch18_1.html">Chapter 18</span>, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, is a special institution that is neither exactly part of the government nor exactly a private institution. When the central bank increases the quantity of money in circulation, households and firms have more money, which they are willing to lend out. The effect is to drive the interest rate down at any given aggregate price level, leading to higher investment spending and higher consumer spending. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_446"><p>446</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p59"><p>That is, increasing the quantity of money shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. Reducing the quantity of money has the opposite effect: households and firms have less money holdings than before, leading them to borrow more and lend less. This raises the interest rate, reduces investment spending and consumer spending, and shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p62"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">W</span>hen looking at data, it’s often hard to distinguish between changes in spending that represent <em>movements along</em> the aggregate demand curve and <em>shift</em>s <em>of</em> the aggregate demand curve. One telling exception, however, is what happened right after the oil crisis of 1979, which we mentioned in this chapter’s opening story. Faced with a sharp increase in the aggregate price level—the rate of consumer price inflation reached 14.8% in March of 1980—the Federal Reserve stuck to a policy of increasing the quantity of money slowly. The aggregate price level was rising steeply, but the quantity of money circulating in the economy was growing slowly. The net result was that the purchasing power of the quantity of money in circulation fell.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p63"><p>This led to an increase in the demand for borrowing and a surge in interest rates. The <em>prime rate,</em> which is the interest rate banks charge their best customers, climbed above 20%. High interest rates, in turn, caused both consumer spending and investment spending to fall: in 1980 purchases of durable consumer goods like cars fell by 5.3% and real investment spending fell by 8.9%.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p64"><p>In other words, in 1979–1980 the economy responded just as we’d expect if it were moving upward along the aggregate demand curve from right to left: due to the wealth effect and the interest rate effect of a change in the aggregate price level, the quantity of aggregate output demanded fell as the aggregate price level rose. This does not explain, of course, why the aggregate price level rose. But as we’ll see in the upcoming section on the <em>AD–AS</em> model, the answer to that question lies in the behavior of the <em>short-run aggregate supply curve.</em> </p></div>
