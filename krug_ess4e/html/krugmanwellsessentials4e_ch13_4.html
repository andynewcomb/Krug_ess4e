<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p89"><p>In 2011 and 2012, Americans were facing sticker shock at the gas pump: the price of a gallon of regular gasoline had risen from an average of $1.61 at the end of December 2008 to close to $4. Many other prices were also up. Some prices, though, were heading down: electronics and some foods, like eggs, were coming down from a run-up in late 2010. Yet practically everyone felt that the overall cost of living was rising. But how fast?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p91"><p>Clearly, there was a need for a single number summarizing what was happening to consumer prices. Just as macroeconomists find it useful to have a single number representing the overall level of output, they also find it useful to have a single number representing the overall level of prices: the <strong>aggregate price level.</strong> Yet a huge variety of goods and services are produced and consumed in the economy. How can we summarize the prices of all these goods and services with a single number? The answer lies in the concept of a <em>price index,</em> which we’ll introduce with an example.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p92"><p>Suppose that a frost in Florida destroys most of the citrus harvest. As a result, the price of an orange rises from $0.20 to $0.40, the price of a grapefruit rises from $0.60 to $1.00, and the price of a lemon rises from $0.25 to $0.45. How much has the price of citrus fruit increased?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p93"><p>One way to answer that question is to state three numbers—the changes in prices for oranges, grapefruit, and lemons. But this is a very cumbersome method. Rather than having to recite three numbers in an effort to track changes in the prices of citrus fruit, we would prefer to have some kind of overall measure of the <em>average</em> price change.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p95"><p>To measure average price changes for consumer goods and services, economists track changes in the cost of a typical consumer’s <em>consumption bundle—</em>the typical basket of goods and services purchased before the price changes. A hypothetical consumption bundle, used to measure changes in the overall price level, is known as a <strong>market basket.</strong> Suppose that before the frost a typical consumer bought 200 oranges, 50 grapefruit, and 100 lemons over the course of a year, our market basket for this example.</p></div>

Since $175/$95 = 1.842, the post-frost basket costs 1.842 times the cost of the pre-frost basket, a cost increase of 84.2%. In this example, the average price of citrus fruit has increased 84.2% since the base year as a result of the frost, where the base year is the initial year used in the measurement of the price change.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p98"><p>Economists use the same method to measure changes in the overall price level: they track changes in the cost of buying a given market basket. In addition, they perform another simplification in order to avoid having to keep track of the information that the market basket cost—for example, to avoid saying that the market basket costs $95 in 1997 dollars and $103 in 2001 dollars. They <em>normalize</em> the measure of the aggregate price level, which means that they set the cost of the market basket equal to 100 in the chosen base year. Working with a market basket and a base year, and after performing normalization, we obtain what is known as a <strong>price index,</strong> a normalized measure of the overall price level. It is always cited along with the year for which the aggregate price level is being measured and the base year. A price index can be calculated using the following formula:</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p99"><p>In our example, the citrus fruit market basket cost $95 in the base year, the year before the frost. So by Equation 13-1 we define the price index for citrus fruit as (cost of market basket in a given year/$95) × 100, yielding an index of 100 for the period before the frost and 184.2 after the frost. You should note that the price index for the base year always results in a price index equal to 100. This is because the price index in the base year is equal to: (cost of market basket in base year/cost of market basket in base year) × 100 = 100.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p100"><p>Thus, the price index makes it clear that the average price of citrus has risen 84.2% as a consequence of the frost. Because of its simplicity and intuitive appeal, the method we’ve just described is used to calculate a variety of price indexes to track average price changes among a variety of different groups of goods and services. For example, the <em>consumer price index,</em> which we’ll discuss shortly, is the most widely used measure of the aggregate price level, the overall price level of final consumer goods and services across the economy.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p105"><p>The most widely used measure of prices in the United States is the <strong>consumer price index</strong> (often referred to simply as the <strong>CPI</strong>), which is intended to show how the cost of all purchases by a typical urban family has changed over time.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p111"><p>There are two other price measures that are also widely used to track economy-wide price changes. One is the <strong>producer price index</strong> (or <strong>PPI,</strong> which used to be known as the <em>wholesale price index</em>). As its name suggests, the producer price index measures the cost of a typical basket of goods and services—containing raw commodities such as steel, electricity, coal, and so on—purchased by producers. Because commodity producers are relatively quick to change prices when they perceive a change in overall demand for their goods, the PPI often responds to inflationary or deflationary pressures more quickly than the CPI. As a result, the PPI is often regarded as an “early warning signal” of changes in the inflation rate.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p113"><p>The other widely used price measure is the <em>GDP deflator;</em> it isn’t exactly a price index, although it serves the same purpose. Recall how we distinguished between nominal GDP (GDP in current prices) and real GDP (GDP calculated using the prices of a base year). The <strong>GDP deflator</strong> for a given year is equal to 100 times the ratio of nominal GDP for that year to real GDP for that year. Since real GDP is currently expressed in 2005 dollars, the GDP deflator for 2005 is equal to 100.

By all three measures, the U.S. economy experienced deflation during the early years of the Great Depression, inflation during World War II, accelerating inflation during the 1970s, and a return to relative price stability in the 1990s. Notice, by the way, the dramatic ups and downs in producer prices from 2000 to 2015 on the graph; this reflects large swings in energy and food prices, which play a much bigger role in the PPI than they do in either the CPI or the GDP deflator.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p118"><p>The practice of indexing payments to consumer prices goes back to the dawn of the United States as a nation. In 1780 the Massachusetts State Legislature recognized that the pay of its soldiers fighting the British needed to be increased because of inflation that occurred during the Revolutionary War. The legislature adopted a formula that made a soldier’s pay proportional to the cost of a market basket, consisting of 5 bushels of corn, 68 4/7 pounds of beef, 10 pounds of sheep’s wool, and 16 pounds of shoe leather.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p119"><p>Today, approximately 56 million people receive payments from Social Security, a national retirement program that accounts for almost a quarter of current total federal spending—more than the defense budget. The amount of an individual’s Social Security payment is determined by a formula that reflects his or her previous payments into the system as well as other factors. In addition, all Social Security payments are adjusted each year to offset any increase in consumer prices over the previous year. The CPI is used to calculate the official estimate of the inflation rate used to adjust these payments yearly. So every percentage point added to the official estimate of the rate of inflation adds 1% to the checks received by tens of millions of individuals.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p120"><p>Other government payments are also indexed to the CPI. In addition, income tax brackets, the bands of income levels that determine a taxpayer’s income tax rate, are also indexed to the CPI. (An individual in a higher income bracket pays a higher income tax rate in a progressive tax system like ours.) Indexing also extends to the private sector, where many private contracts, including some wage settlements, contain cost-of-living allowances (called COLAs) that adjust payments in proportion to changes in the CPI.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p121"><p>Because the CPI plays such an important and direct role in people’s lives, it’s a politically sensitive number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the CPI, takes great care in collecting and interpreting price and consumption data. It uses a complex method in which households are surveyed to determine what they buy and where they shop, and a carefully selected sample of stores are surveyed to get representative prices.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="sr1-bl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p123"><p>The <strong>inflation rate</strong> is calculated as the percent change in a price index. The most commonly used price index is the <strong>consumer price index,</strong> or <strong>CPI,</strong> which tracks the cost of a basket of consumer goods and services. The <strong>producer price index,</strong> or <strong>PPI,</strong> does the same for goods and services used as inputs by firms. The <strong>GDP deflator</strong> measures the aggregate price level as the ratio of nominal to real GDP times 100. These three measures normally behave quite similarly.</p></div>
