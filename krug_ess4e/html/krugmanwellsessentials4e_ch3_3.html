<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p32"><p>How much natural gas will American consumers want to buy in a given year? You might at first think that we can answer this question by adding up the amounts each American household and business consumes in that year. But that’s not enough to answer the question, because how much natural gas Americans want to buy depends upon the price of natural gas.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p33"><p>When the price of natural gas falls, as it did from 2006 to 2015, consumers will generally respond to the lower price by using more natural gas—for example, by turning up their thermostats to keep their houses warmer in the winter or switching to vehicles powered by natural gas. In general, the amount of natural gas, or of any good or service that people want to buy, depends upon the price. The higher the price, the less of the good or service people want to purchase; alternatively, the lower the price, the more they want to purchase.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p34"><p>So the answer to the question “How many units of natural gas do consumers want to buy?” depends on the price of a unit of natural gas. If you don’t yet know what the price will be, you can start by making a table of how many units of natural gas people would want to buy at a number of different prices. Such a table is known as a <em>demand schedule</em>. This, in turn, can be used to draw a <em>demand curve</em>, which is one of the key elements of the supply and demand model.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p45"><p>Although natural gas prices in 2006 were higher than they had been in 2002, U.S. consumption of natural gas was higher in 2006. How can we reconcile this fact with the law of demand, which says that a higher price reduces the quantity demanded, other things equal?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p46"><p>The answer lies in the crucial phrase <em>other things equal</em>. In this case, other things weren’t equal: the U.S. economy had changed between 2002 and 2006 in ways that increased the amount of natural gas demanded at any given price. For one thing, the U.S. economy was much stronger in 2006 than in 2002. <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch3/KrugESS4e_fig_3_02.html">Figure 3-2</span> illustrates this phenomenon using the demand schedule and demand curve for natural gas.

It differs from the 2002 schedule because of the stronger U.S. economy, leading to an increase in the quantity of natural gas demanded at any given price. So at each price the 2006 schedule shows a larger quantity demanded than the 2002 schedule. For example, the quantity of natural gas consumers wanted to buy at a price of $3 per BTU increased from 10 trillion to 12 trillion BTUs per year; the quantity demanded at $3.25 per BTU went from 8.9 trillion to 10.7 trillion, and so on.</p></div>

In ordinary speech most people, including professional economists, use the word <em>demand</em> casually.

<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p60"><p>It’s OK to be a bit sloppy in ordinary conversation. But when you’re doing economic analysis, it’s important to make the distinction between changes in the quantity demanded, which involve movements along a demand curve, and shifts of the demand curve (see <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch3/KrugESS4e_fig_3_03.html">Figure 3-3</span> for an illustration). Sometimes students end up writing something like this: “If demand increases, the price will go up, but that will lead to a fall in demand, which pushes the price down …” and then go around in circles. If you make a clear distinction between changes in <em>demand,</em> which mean shifts of the demand curve, and changes in <em>quantity demanded,</em> which means movement along the demand curve, you can avoid a lot of confusion.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p62"><p>What caused the demand curve for natural gas to shift? As we mentioned earlier, the reason was the stronger U.S. economy in 2006 compared to 2002. If you think about it, you can come up with other factors that would be likely to shift the demand curve for natural gas. For example, suppose that the price of heating oil rises. This will induce some consumers, who heat their homes and businesses in winter with heating oil, to switch to natural gas instead, increasing the demand for natural gas.</p></div>

So when we say that the quantity of a good or service demanded falls as its price rises, <em>other things equal</em>, we are in fact stating that the factors that shift demand are remaining unchanged. Let’s now explore, in more detail, how those factors shift the demand curve.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p71"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Changes in the Prices of Related Goods or Services</strong></span> Heating oil is what economists call a <em>substitute</em> for natural gas. A pair of goods are <strong>substitutes</strong> if a rise in the price of one good (heating oil) makes consumers more likely to buy the other good (natural gas). Substitutes are usually goods that in some way serve a similar function: coffee and tea, muffins and doughnuts, train rides and air flights. A rise in the price of the alternative good induces some consumers to purchase the original good <em>instead</em> of it, shifting demand for the original good to the right.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p73"><p>But sometimes a rise in the price of one good makes consumers <em>less</em> willing to buy another good. Such pairs of goods are known as <strong>complements</strong>. Complements are usually goods that in some sense are consumed together: computers and software, cappuccinos and cookies, cars and gasoline. Because consumers like to consume a good and its complement together, a change in the price of one of the goods will affect the demand for its complement. In particular, when the price of one good rises, the demand for its complement decreases, shifting the demand curve for the complement to the left. So, for example, when the price of gasoline began to rise in 2009 from under $3 per gallon to close to $4 per gallon in 2011, the demand for gas-guzzling cars fell.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p74"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Changes in Income</strong></span> Why did the stronger economy in 2006 lead to an increase in the demand for natural gas compared to the demand during the weak economy of 2002? Because with the stronger economy, Americans had more income, making them more likely to purchase more of <em>most</em> goods and services at any given price. For example, with a higher income you are likely to keep your house warmer in the winter than if your income is low.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p75"><p>And, the demand for natural gas, a major source of fuel for electricity-generating power plants, is tied to the demand for other goods and services. For example, businesses must consume power in order to provide goods and services to households. So when the economy is strong and household incomes are high, businesses will consume more electricity and, indirectly, more natural gas.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p78"><p>Why do we say that people are likely to purchase more of “most goods,” not “all goods”? Most goods are <strong>normal goods</strong><strong>—</strong>the demand for them increases when consumer income rises. However, the demand for some products falls when income rises. Goods for which demand decreases when income rises are known as <strong>inferior goods</strong>. Usually an inferior good is one that is considered less desirable than more expensive alternatives—such as a bus ride versus a taxi ride. When they can afford to, people stop buying an inferior good and switch their consumption to the preferred, more expensive alternative. So when a good is inferior, a rise in income shifts the demand curve to the left. And, not surprisingly, a fall in income shifts the demand curve to the right.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_74"><p>74</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p79"><p>One example of the distinction between normal and inferior goods that has drawn considerable attention in the business press is the difference between so-called casual-dining restaurants such as Applebee’s or Olive Garden and fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC. When their incomes rise, Americans tend to eat out more at casual-dining restaurants. However, some of this increased dining out comes at the expense of fast-food venues—to some extent, people visit McDonald’s less once they can afford to move upscale. So casual dining is a normal good, whereas fast-food consumption appears to be an inferior good.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p80"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Changes in Tastes</strong></span> Why do people want what they want? Fortunately, we don’t need to answer that question—we just need to acknowledge that people have certain preferences, or tastes, that determine what they choose to consume and that these tastes can change. Economists usually lump together changes in demand due to fads, beliefs, cultural shifts, and so on under the heading of changes in tastes or preferences.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p81"><p>For example, once upon a time men wore hats. Up until around World War II, a respectable man wasn’t fully dressed unless he wore a dignified hat along with his suit. But the returning GIs adopted a more informal style, perhaps due to the rigors of the war. And President Eisenhower, who had been supreme commander of Allied Forces before becoming president, often went hatless. After World War II, it was clear that the demand curve for hats had shifted leftward, reflecting a decrease in the demand for hats.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p82"><p>Economists have relatively little to say about the forces that influence consumers’ tastes. (Although marketers and advertisers have plenty to say about them!) However, a change in tastes has a predictable impact on demand. When tastes change in favor of a good, more people want to buy it at any given price, so the demand curve shifts to the right. When tastes change against a good, fewer people want to buy it at any given price, so the demand curve shifts to the left.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p83"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Changes in Expectations</strong></span> When consumers have some choice about when to make a purchase, current demand for a good is often affected by expectations about its future price. For example, savvy shoppers often wait for seasonal sales—say, buying next year’s holiday gifts during the post-holiday markdowns. In this case, expectations of a future drop in price lead to a decrease in demand today. Alternatively, expectations of a future rise in price are likely to cause an increase in demand today.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p84"><p>For example, the fall in gas prices in recent years to around $2 per BTU has spurred more consumers to switch to natural gas from other fuel types than when natural gas fell to $2 per BTU in 2002. But why are consumers more willing to switch now? Because in 2002, consumers didn’t expect the fall in the price of natural gas to last—and they were right.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p85"><p>In 2002, natural gas prices fell because of the weak economy. That situation changed in 2006 when the economy came roaring back and the price of natural gas rose dramatically. In contrast, consumers have come to expect that the more recent fall in the price of natural gas will not be temporary because it is based on a permanent change: the ability to tap much larger deposits of natural gas.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p86"><p>Expected changes in future income can also lead to changes in demand: if you expect your income to rise in the future, you will typically borrow today and increase your demand for certain goods; if you expect your income to fall in the future, you are likely to save today and reduce your demand for some goods.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p87"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Changes in the Number of Consumers</strong></span> Another factor that can cause a change in demand is a change in the number of consumers of a good or service. For example, population growth in the United States eventually leads to higher demand for natural gas as more homes and businesses need to be heated in the winter and cooled in the summer.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p89"><p>Let’s introduce a new concept: the <strong>individual demand curve</strong>, which shows the relationship between quantity demanded and price for an individual consumer.

Given that the Gonzalez family and the Murray family are the only two consumers, the <em>market demand curve,</em> which shows the quantity of BTUs demanded by all consumers at any given price, is shown in panel (c). The market demand curve is the <em>horizontal sum</em> of the individual demand curves of all consumers. In this case, at any given price, the quantity demanded by the market is the sum of the quantities demanded by the Gonzalez family and the Murray family.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p90"><p>The <em>market demand curve</em> shows how the combined quantity demanded by all consumers depends on the market price of the good. (Most of the time when economists refer to the demand curve they mean the market demand curve.) The market demand curve is the <em>horizontal sum</em> of the individual demand curves of all consumers in that market. To see what we mean by the term <em>horizontal sum</em>, assume for a moment that there are only two consumers of natural gas, the Gonzalez family and the Murray family. The Murray family consumes natural gas to fuel their natural gas–powered car. The Murray family’s individual demand curve, <em>D<sub>Murray</sub></em>, is shown in panel (b). Panel (c) shows the market demand curve. At any given price, the quantity demanded by the market is the sum of the quantities demanded by the Gonzalez family and the Murray family. For example, at a price of $5 per BTU, the Gonzalez family demands 30 BTUs of natural gas per year and the Murray family demands 20 BTUs per year. So the quantity demanded by the market is 50 BTUs per year, as seen on the market demand curve, <em>D<sub>Market</sub></em>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p91"><p>Clearly, the quantity demanded by the market at any given price is larger with the Murray family present than it would be if the Gonzalez family were the only consumer. The quantity demanded at any given price would be even larger if we added a third consumer, then a fourth, and so on. So an increase in the number of consumers leads to an increase in demand.</p></div>

If we think of an auto trip to the city center as a good that people consume, we can use the economics of demand to analyze anti-traffic policies.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p96"><p>One common strategy is to reduce the demand for auto trips by lowering the prices of substitutes. Many metropolitan areas subsidize bus and rail service, hoping to lure commuters out of their cars. An alternative is to raise the price of complements: several major U.S. cities impose high taxes on commercial parking garages and impose short time limits on parking meters, both to raise revenue and to discourage people from driving into the city.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p97"><p>A few major cities—including Singapore, London, Oslo, Stockholm, and Milan—have been willing to adopt a direct and politically controversial approach: reducing congestion by raising the price of driving. Under “congestion pricing” (or “congestion charging” in the United Kingdom), a charge is imposed on cars entering the city center during business hours. Drivers buy passes, which are then debited electronically as they drive by monitoring stations. Compliance is monitored with automatic cameras that photograph license plates.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p98"><p>The current daily cost of driving in London ranges from £9 to £12 (about $14 to $19). And drivers who don’t pay and are caught pay a fine of £120 (about $192) for each transgression.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p99"><p>Not surprisingly, studies have shown that after the implementation of congestion pricing, traffic does indeed decrease. In the 1990s, London had some of the worst traffic in Europe. The introduction of its congestion charge in 2003 immediately reduced traffic in the city center by about 15%, with overall traffic falling by 21% between 2002 and 2006. And there has been increased use of substitutes, such as public transportation, bicycles, motorbikes, and ride-sharing. From 2001 to 2011, bike trips in London increased by 79%, and bus usage was up by 30%.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p100"><p>In the United States, the U.S. Department of Transportation has implemented pilot programs to study congestion pricing. For example, in 2012 Los Angeles County imposed a congestion charge on an 11-mile stretch of highway in central Los Angeles. Drivers pay up to $1.40 per mile, the amount depending upon traffic congestion, with a money-back guarantee that their average speed will never drop below 45 miles per hour. While some drivers were understandably annoyed at the charge, others were more philosophical. One driver felt that the toll was a fair price to escape what often turned into a crawling 45-minute drive, saying, “It’s worth it if you’re in a hurry to get home. You got to pay the price. If not, get stuck in traffic.”</p></div>
