<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p126"><p>New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country, lying along the northeastern corridor, an area of almost continuous development stretching from Washington, D.C., to Boston. Yet a drive through New Jersey reveals a surprising feature: acre upon acre of farmland, growing everything from corn to pumpkins to the famous Jersey tomatoes. This situation is no accident: starting in 1961, New Jerseyans have voted in a series of measures that subsidize farmers to permanently preserve their farmland rather than sell it to developers. By 2013, the Green Acres Program, administered by the state, had preserved over 640,000 acres of open space.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_299"><p>299</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p127"><p>Why have New Jersey citizens voted to raise their own taxes to subsidize the preservation of farmland? Because they believe that preserved farmland in an already heavily developed state provides external benefits, such as natural beauty, access to fresh food, and the conservation of wild bird populations. In addition, preservation alleviates the external costs that come with more development, such as pressure on roads, water supplies, and municipal services—and, inevitably, more pollution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p128"><p>In this section we’ll explore the topics of external benefits and positive externalities. They are, in many ways, the mirror images of external costs and negative externalities. Left to its own, the market will produce too little of a good (in this case, preserved New Jersey farmland) that confers external benefits on others. But society as a whole is better off when policies are adopted that increase the supply of such a good.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p129"><p>Preserved farmland yields both benefits and costs to society. In the absence of government intervention, the farmer who wants to sell his land incurs all the costs of preservation—namely, the forgone profit to be made from selling the farmland to a developer. But the benefits of preserved farmland accrue not to the farmer but to neighboring residents, who have no right to influence how the farmland is disposed of.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p130"><p><span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch10/KrugESS4e_fig_10_04.html">Figure 10-4</span> illustrates society’s problem. The marginal social cost of preserved farmland, shown by the <em>MSC</em> curve, is the additional cost imposed on society by an additional acre of such farmland. This represents the forgone profits that would have accrued to farmers if they had sold their land to developers. The line is upward sloping because when very few acres are preserved and there is plenty of land available for development, the profit that could be made from selling an acre to a developer is small. But as the number of preserved acres increases and few are left for development, the amount a developer is willing to pay for them, and therefore the forgone profit, increases as well.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p131"><p>The <em>MSB</em> curve represents the marginal social benefit of preserved farmland. It is the additional benefit that accrues to society—in this case, the farmer’s neighbors—when an additional acre of farmland is preserved. The curve is downward sloping because as more farmland is preserved, the benefit to society of preserving another acre falls.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p132"><p>As <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch10/KrugESS4e_fig_10_04.html">Figure 10-4</span> shows, the socially optimal point, <em>O,</em> occurs when the marginal social cost and the marginal social benefit are equalized—here, at a price of $10,000 per acre. At the socially optimal point, <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub></em> acres of farmland are preserved.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p133"><p>The market alone will not provide <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub></em> acres of preserved farmland. Instead, in the market outcome no acres will be preserved; the level of preserved farmland, <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub>,</em> is equal to zero. That’s because farmers will set the marginal social cost of preservation—their forgone profits—at zero and sell all their acres to developers. Because farmers bear the entire cost of preservation but gain none of the benefits, an inefficiently low quantity of acres will be preserved in the market outcome.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p135"><p>This is clearly inefficient because at zero acres preserved, the marginal social benefit of preserving an acre of farmland is $20,000. So how can the economy be induced to produce <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub></em> acres of preserved farmland, the socially optimal level? The answer is a <strong>Pigouvian subsidy:</strong> a payment designed to encourage activities that yield external benefits. The optimal Pigouvian subsidy, as shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch10/KrugESS4e_fig_10_04.html">Figure 10-4</span>, is equal to the marginal social benefit of preserved farmland at the socially optimal level, <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub></em>—that is, $10,000 per acre.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p136"><p>So New Jersey voters are indeed implementing the right policy to raise their social welfare—taxing themselves in order to provide subsidies for farmland preservation.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p138"><p>In the overall U.S. economy, the most important single source of external benefits is the creation of knowledge. In high-tech industries such as semiconductors, software design, green technology, and bioengineering, innovations by one firm are quickly emulated and improved upon by rival firms. Such spreading of knowledge across individuals and firms is known as a <strong>technology spillover.</strong> In today’s economy, the greatest sources of technology spillovers are major universities and research institutes.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p139"><p>In technologically advanced countries such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Israel, there is an ongoing exchange of people and ideas among private industries, major universities, and research institutes located in close proximity. The dynamic interplay that occurs in these <em>research clusters</em> spurs innovation and competition, theoretical advances, and practical applications.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p140"><p>One of the best known and most successful research clusters is the Research Triangle in North Carolina, anchored by Duke University and the University of North Carolina, several other universities and hospitals, and companies such as IBM, Pfizer, and Qualcomm. Ultimately, these areas of technology spillover increase the economy’s productivity and raise living standards.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p141"><p>But research clusters don’t appear out of thin air. Except in a few instances in which firms have funded basic research on a long-term basis, research clusters have grown up around major universities. And like farmland preservation in New Jersey, major universities and their research activities are subsidized by government. In fact, government policy makers in advanced countries have long understood that the external benefits generated by knowledge, stemming from basic education to high-tech research, are key to the economy’s growth over time.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p145"><p>Early-childhood intervention has offered some hope of breaking the cycle. A study by the RAND Corporation found that high-quality early-childhood programs that focus on education and health care lead to significant social, intellectual, and financial advantages for kids who would otherwise be at risk of dropping out of high school and of engaging in criminal behavior. Children in programs like Head Start were less likely to engage in such destructive behaviors and more likely to end up with a job and to earn a high salary later in life.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p146"><p>Another study by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh looked at early-childhood intervention programs from a dollars-and-cents perspective, finding from $4 to $7 in benefits for every $1 spent on early-childhood intervention programs, while a Rand study put the figure as high as $17 per $1 spent. The Pittsburgh study also pointed to one program whose participants, by age 20, were 26% more likely to have finished high school, 35% less likely to have been charged in juvenile court, and 40% less likely to have repeated a grade compared to individuals of similar socioeconomic background who did not attend preschool.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p147"><p>The observed external benefits to society of these programs are so large that the Brookings Institution predicts that providing high-quality preschool education to every American child would result in an increase in GDP, the total value of a country’s domestic output, by almost 2%, representing over 3 million more jobs.</p></div>
