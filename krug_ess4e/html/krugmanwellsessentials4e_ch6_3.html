</h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p82"><p>We’ve just learned how to derive a firm’s total cost curve from its production function. Our next step is to take a deeper look at total cost by deriving two extremely useful measures: <em>marginal cost</em> and <em>average cost.</em> As we’ll see, these two measures of the cost of production have a somewhat surprising relationship to each other. Moreover, they will prove to be vitally important later when we use them to analyze the firm’s output decision and the market supply curve.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p84"><p><strong>Marginal cost</strong> is the change in total cost generated by producing one more unit of output. We’ve already seen that the marginal product of an input is easiest to calculate if data on output are available in increments of one unit of that input. Similarly, marginal cost is easiest to calculate if data on total cost are available in increments of one unit of output. When the data come in less convenient increments, it’s still possible to calculate marginal cost. But for the sake of simplicity, let’s work with an example in which the data come in convenient one-unit increments.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p88"><p>As in the case of marginal product, marginal cost is equal to “rise” (the increase in total cost) divided by “run” (the increase in the quantity of output).

Notice that, as in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/KrugESS4e_fig_6_02.html">Figure 6-2</span>, we plot the marginal cost for increasing output from 0 to 1 case of salsa halfway between 0 and 1, the marginal cost for increasing output from 1 to 2 cases of salsa halfway between 1 and 2, and so on.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p90"><p>Why does the marginal cost curve slope upward? Because there are diminishing returns to inputs in this example. As output increases, the marginal product of the variable input declines. This implies that more and more of the variable input must be used to produce each additional unit of output as the amount of output already produced rises. And since each unit of the variable input must be paid for, the additional cost per additional unit of output also rises.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p91"><p>In addition, recall that the flattening of the total product curve is also due to diminishing returns: the marginal product of an input falls as more of that input is used if the quantities of other inputs are fixed. The flattening of the total product curve as output increases and the steepening of the total cost curve as output increases are just flip-sides of the same phenomenon. That is, as output increases, the marginal cost of output also increases because the marginal product of the variable input decreases.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p92"><p>We will return to marginal cost in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch7_1.html">Chapter 7</span>, when we consider the firm’s profit-maximizing output decision.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p94"><p>In addition to total cost and marginal cost, it’s useful to calculate another measure, <strong>average total cost,</strong> often simply called <strong>average cost.</strong> The average total cost is total cost divided by the quantity of output produced; that is, it is equal to total cost per unit of output.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p102"><p>Average total cost is the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. It has a U shape because these components move in opposite directions as output rises.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p103"><p>Average fixed cost falls as more output is produced because the numerator (the fixed cost) is a fixed number but the denominator (the quantity of output) increases as more is produced. Another way to think about this relationship is that, as more output is produced, the fixed cost is spread over more units of output; the end result is that the fixed cost <em>per unit of output</em>—the average fixed cost—falls. You can see this effect in the fourth column of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/table_6_3.html">Table 6-2</span>: average fixed cost drops continuously as output increases.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p104"><p>Average variable cost, however, rises as output increases. As we’ve seen, this reflects diminishing returns to the variable input: each additional unit of output incurs more variable cost to produce than the previous unit. So variable cost rises at a faster rate than the quantity of output increases.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p105"><p>So increasing output has two opposing effects on average total cost—the “spreading effect” and the “diminishing returns effect”:</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bullet" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-list-4">
<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p106"><p><em>The spreading effect.</em> The larger the output, the greater the quantity of output over which fixed cost is spread, leading to lower average fixed cost.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p107"><p><em>The diminishing returns effect.</em> The larger the output, the greater the amount of variable input required to produce additional units, leading to higher average variable cost.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p108"><p>At low levels of output, the spreading effect is very powerful because even small increases in output cause large reductions in average fixed cost. So at low levels of output, the spreading effect dominates the diminishing returns effect and causes the average total cost curve to slope downward. But when output is large, average fixed cost is already quite small, so increasing output further has only a very small spreading effect.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p109"><p>Diminishing returns, however, usually grow increasingly important as output rises. As a result, when output is large, the diminishing returns effect dominates the spreading effect, causing the average total cost curve to slope upward. At the bottom of the U-shaped average total cost curve, point <em>M</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/KrugESS4e_fig_6_07.html">Figure 6-7</span>, the two effects exactly balance each other.

First of all, marginal cost slopes upward—the result of diminishing returns that make an additional unit of output more costly to produce than the one before. Average variable cost also slopes upward—again, due to diminishing returns—but is flatter than the marginal cost curve. This is because the higher cost of an additional unit of output is averaged across all units, not just the additional units, in the average variable cost measure.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p124"><p>Up to this point, we have emphasized the importance of diminishing returns, which lead to a marginal product curve that always slopes downward and a marginal cost curve that always slopes upward. In practice, however, economists believe that marginal cost curves often slope <em>downward</em> as a firm increases its production from zero up to some low level, sloping upward only at higher levels of production: they look like the curve <em>MC</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/KrugESS4e_fig_6_10.html">Figure 6-10</span>.</p></div>

<span data-type="number">Figure 6.10: </span><span data-type="caption">A realistic marginal cost curve has a “swoosh” shape. Starting from a very low output level, marginal cost often falls as the firm increases output. That’s because hiring additional workers allows greater specialization of their tasks and leads to increasing returns. Once specialization is achieved, however, diminishing returns to additional workers set in and marginal cost rises. The corresponding average variable cost curve is now U-shaped, like the average total cost curve.</span>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p125"><p>This initial downward slope occurs because a firm often finds that, when it starts with only a very small number of workers, employing more workers and expanding output allows its workers to specialize in various tasks. This, in turn, lowers the firm’s marginal cost as it expands output. For example, one individual producing salsa would have to perform all the tasks involved: selecting and preparing the ingredients, mixing the salsa, bottling and labeling it, packing it into cases, and so on. As more workers are employed, they can divide the tasks, with each worker specializing in one or a few aspects of salsa-making.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p126"><p>This specialization leads to <em>increasing returns</em> to the hiring of additional workers and results in a marginal cost curve that initially slopes downward. But once there are enough workers to have completely exhausted the benefits of further specialization, diminishing returns to labor set in and the marginal cost curve changes direction and slopes upward. So typical marginal cost curves actually have the “swoosh” shape shown by <em>MC</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/KrugESS4e_fig_6_10.html">Figure 6-10</span>. For the same reason, average variable cost curves typically look like <em>AVC</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch6/KrugESS4e_fig_6_10.html">Figure 6-10</span>: they are U-shaped rather than strictly upward sloping.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch6-p134"><p>To solve this inefficiency, utility companies, appliance manufacturers, and the federal government are working together to develop SMART Grid technologies—that help consumers adjust their usage according to the true marginal cost of a kilowatt in real time. “Smart” meters have been developed for home use, which allow the price to the consumer to vary according to the true marginal cost—which the consumer can see.
