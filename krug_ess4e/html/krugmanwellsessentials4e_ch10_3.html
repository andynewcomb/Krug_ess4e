<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p75"><p>Before 1970, there were no rules governing the amount of sulfur dioxide that coal-burning power plants in the United States could emit—which is why acid rain got to be such a big problem.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p76"><p>In 1970, Congress adopted the Clean Air Act, which set rules forcing power plants to reduce their emissions. And it worked—the acidity of rainfall declined significantly. Economists, however, argued that a more flexible system of rules that exploits the effectiveness of markets could reduce pollution at a lower cost. In 1990 this theory was put into effect with a modified version of the Clean Air Act. And guess what? The economists were right!</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p78"><p>The most serious external costs in the modern world are surely those associated with actions that damage the environment—air pollution, water pollution, habitat destruction, and so on. Protection of the environment has become a major role of government in all advanced nations. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is the principal enforcer of environmental policies at the national level, supported by the actions of state and local governments.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p80"><p>How does a country protect its environment? At present the main policy tools are <strong>environmental standards,</strong> rules that protect the environment by specifying actions by producers and consumers. A familiar example is the law that requires almost all vehicles to have catalytic converters, which reduce the emission of chemicals that can cause smog and lead to health problems. Other rules require communities to treat their sewage or factories to avoid or limit certain kinds of pollution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p81"><p>Environmental standards came into widespread use in the 1960s and 1970s, and they have had considerable success in reducing pollution. For example, since the United States passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, overall emission of pollutants into the air has fallen by more than a third, even though the population has grown by a third and the size of the economy has more than doubled. Even in Los Angeles, still famous for its smog, the air has improved dramatically: in 1976 ozone levels in the South Coast Air Basin exceeded federal standards on 194 days; in 2013, on only 5 days.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p83"><p>Another way to deal with pollution directly is to charge polluters an <strong>emissions tax,</strong> taxes that depend on the amount of pollution a firm emits. As we learned in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch5_1.html">Chapter 5</span>, a tax imposed on an activity will reduce the level of that activity. Looking again at <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch10/KrugESS4e_fig_10_02.html">Figure 10-2</span>, we can find the amount of tax on emissions that moves the market to the socially optimal point. At <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub>,</em> the socially optimal quantity of pollution, the marginal social benefit and marginal social cost of an additional unit of pollution is equal at $200. But in the absence of government intervention, polluters will push pollution up to the quantity <em>Q<sub>MKT</sub>,</em> at which marginal social benefit is zero.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p84"><p>It’s now easy to see how an emissions tax can solve the problem. If polluters are required to pay a tax of $200 per unit of pollution, they now face a marginal cost of $200 per unit and have an incentive to reduce their emissions to <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub>,</em> the socially optimal quantity. This illustrates a general result: an emissions tax equal to the marginal social cost at the socially optimal quantity of pollution induces polluters to internalize the externality—to take into account the true cost to society of their actions.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p86"><p>The term <em>emissions tax</em> may convey the misleading impression that taxes are a solution to only one kind of external cost, pollution. In fact, taxes can be used to discourage any activity that generates negative externalities, such as driving (which inflicts environmental damage greater than the cost of producing gasoline) or smoking (which inflicts health costs on society far greater than the cost of making a cigarette). In general, taxes designed to reduce external costs are known as <strong>Pigouvian taxes,</strong> after the economist A. C. Pigou, who emphasized their usefulness in his classic 1920 book, <em>The Economics of Welfare.</em> In our example, the optimal Pigouvian tax is $200. As you can see from <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch10/KrugESS4e_fig_10_02.html">Figure 10-2</span>, this corresponds to the marginal social cost of pollution at the optimal output quantity <em>Q<sub>OPT</sub>.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_294"><p>294</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p88"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">A</span>t first glance, a comparison of the per capita greenhouse gas emissions of various countries, shown in panel (a) of the following graph, suggests that Australia, Canada, and the United States are the worst offenders. The average American is responsible for 16.1 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (measured in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents)—the pollution that causes climate change—compared to only 3.9 tonnes for the average Uzbek, 6.7 tonnes for the average Chinese, and 1.8 tonnes for the average Indian. (A tonne, also called a metric ton, equals 1.10 ton.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p89"><p>Such a conclusion, however, ignores an important factor in determining the level of a country’s greenhouse gas emissions: its gross domestic product, or GDP—the total value of a country’s domestic output. Output typically cannot be produced without more energy, and more energy usage typically results in more pollution. In fact, some have argued that criticizing a country’s level of greenhouse gases without taking account of its level of economic development is misguided. It would be equivalent to faulting a country for being at a more advanced stage of economic development.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p90"><p>A more meaningful way to compare pollution across countries is to measure emissions per $1 million of a country’s GDP, as shown in panel (b). On this basis, the United States, Canada, and Australia are now “green” countries, but China, India, and Uzbekistan are not. What explains the reversal once GDP is accounted for? The answer: both economics and government behavior.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p91"><p>First, there is the issue of economics. Countries that are poor and have begun to industrialize, such as China and Uzbekistan, often view money spent to reduce pollution as better spent on other things. From their perspective, they are still too poor to afford as clean an environment as wealthy advanced countries. They claim that to impose a wealthy country’s environmental standards on them would jeopardize their economic growth.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p92"><p>Second, there is the issue of government behavior—or more precisely, whether or not a government possesses the tools necessary to effectively control pollution. China is a good illustration of this problem. The Chinese government lacks sufficient regulatory power to enforce its own environmental rules, promote energy conservation, or encourage pollution reduction. To produce $1 of GDP, China spends three times the world average on energy—far more than Indonesia, for example, which is also a poor country. The case of China illustrates just how important government intervention is in improving society’s welfare in the presence of externalities.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p93"><p>Are there any problems with emissions taxes? The main concern is that in practice government officials usually aren’t sure how high the tax should be set. If set too low, there won’t be sufficient reduction in pollution; if set too high, emissions will be reduced by more than is efficient. This uncertainty around the optimal level of the emissions tax can’t be eliminated, but the nature of the risks can be changed by using an alternative policy, issuing tradable emissions permits.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p95"><p><strong>Tradable emissions permits</strong> are licenses to emit limited quantities of pollutants that can be bought and sold by polluters. Firms that pollute typically have different costs of reducing pollution—for example, it will be more costly for plants using older technology to reduce pollution than plants using newer technology. Regulators begin the system by issuing polluters with permits to pollute based on some formula—say, for example, equal to 50% of a given firm’s historical level of emissions. Firms then have the right to trade permits among themselves. Under this system, a market in permits to pollute will emerge. Polluters who place a higher value on the right to pollute—those with older technology—will purchase permits from polluters who place a lower value on the right to pollute—those with newer technology. As a result, a polluter with a higher value for a unit of emissions will pollute more than a polluter with a lower value.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p96"><p>In the end, those with the lowest cost of reducing pollution will reduce their pollution the most, while those with the highest cost of reducing pollution will reduce their pollution the least. The total effect is to allocate pollution reduction efficiently—that is, in the least costly way.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p97"><p>Just like emissions taxes, tradable emissions permits provide polluters with an incentive to take the marginal social cost of pollution into account. To see why, suppose that the market price of a permit to emit one unit of pollution is $200. Every polluter now has an incentive to limit its emissions to the point where its marginal benefit of one unit of pollution is $200. Why?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p98"><p>If the marginal benefit of one more unit of pollution is greater than $200 then it is cheaper to pollute more than to pollute less. In that case the polluter will buy a permit and emit another unit. And if the marginal benefit of one more unit of pollution is less than $200, then it is cheaper to reduce pollution than to pollute more. In that scenario the polluter will reduce pollution rather than buy the $200 permit.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p99"><p>From this example we can see how an emissions permit leads to the same outcome as an emissions tax when they are the same amount: a polluter who pays $200 for the right to emit one unit faces the same incentives as a polluter who faces an emissions tax of $200 per unit. And it’s equally true for polluters that have received more permits from regulators than they plan to use: by not emitting one unit of pollution, a polluter frees up a permit that it can sell for $200. In other words, the opportunity cost of a unit of pollution to this firm is $200, regardless of whether it is used.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p100"><p>Recall that when using emissions taxes to arrive at the optimal level of pollution, the problem arises of finding the right amount of the tax: if the tax is too low, too much pollution is emitted; if the tax is too high, too little pollution is emitted (in other words, too many resources are spent reducing pollution). A similar problem with tradable emissions permits is getting the quantity of permits right, which is much like the flip-side of getting the level of the tax right.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p101"><p>Because it is difficult to determine the optimal quantity of pollution, regulators can find themselves either issuing too many permits, so that there is insufficient pollution reduction, or issuing too few, so that there is too much pollution reduction.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p102"><p>In the case of sulfur dioxide pollution, the U.S. government first relied on environmental standards, but then turned to a system of tradable emissions permits. Currently the largest emissions permit trading system is the European Union system for controlling emissions of carbon dioxide.</p></div>

<span data-type="number">Figure 10.3: </span><span data-type="caption">In both panels, <em>MB<sub>A</sub></em> shows the marginal benefit of pollution to plant <em>A</em> and <em>MB<sub>B</sub></em> shows the marginal benefit of pollution to plant <em>B</em>. In the absence of government intervention, each plant would emit 600 units. However, the cost of reducing emissions is lower for plant <em>A</em>, as shown by the fact that <em>MB<sub>A</sub></em> lies below <em>MB<sub>B</sub></em>. Panel (a) shows the result of an environmental standard that requires both plants to cut emissions in half; this is inefficient, because it leaves the marginal benefit of pollution higher for plant <em>B</em> than for plant <em>A</em>. Panel (b) shows that an emissions tax as well as a system of tradable permits achieves the same quantity of overall pollution efficiently. Faced with either an emissions tax of $200 per unit, or a market price of a permit of $200 per unit, each plant reduces pollution to the point where its marginal benefit is $200.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p104"><p>In the absence of government action, we know that polluters will pollute until the marginal social benefit of a unit of pollution is equal to zero. As a result, without government intervention each plant will pollute until its own marginal benefit of pollution is equal to zero. This corresponds to an emissions quantity of 600 units for each plant—the quantities of pollution at which <em>MB<sub>A</sub></em> and <em>MB<sub>B</sub></em> are equal to zero. So although plant A and plant B have different costs of pollution reduction, they will each choose to emit the same amount of pollution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p105"><p>Now suppose that regulators decide that the overall pollution from this industry should be cut in half, from 1,200 units to 600 units. Panel (a) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch10/KrugESS4e_fig_10_03.html">Figure 10-3</span> shows this might be achieved with an environmental standard that requires each plant to cut its emissions in half, from 600 to 300 units. The standard has the desired effect of reducing overall emissions from 1,200 to 600 units but accomplishes it inefficiently.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_297"><p>297</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p106"><p>As you can see from panel (a), the environmental standard leads plant A to produce at point <em>S<sub>A</sub>,</em> where its marginal benefit of pollution is $150, but plant B produces at point <em>S<sub>B</sub>,</em> where its marginal benefit of pollution is twice as high, $300.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p107"><p>This difference in marginal benefits between the two plants tells us that the same quantity of pollution can be achieved at lower total cost by allowing plant B to pollute more than 300 units but inducing plant A to pollute less. In fact, the efficient way to reduce pollution is to ensure that at the industry-wide outcome, the marginal benefit of pollution is the same for all plants. When each plant values a unit of pollution equally, there is no way to rearrange pollution reduction among the various plants that achieves the optimal quantity of pollution at a lower total cost.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p108"><p>We can see from panel (b) how an emissions tax achieves exactly that result. Suppose both plant A and plant B pay an emissions tax of $200 per unit, so that the marginal cost of an additional unit of emissions to each plant is now $200 rather than zero. As a result, plant A produces at <em>T<sub>A</sub></em> and plant B produces at <em>T<sub>B</sub>.</em> So plant A reduces its pollution more than it would under an inflexible environmental standard, cutting its emissions from 600 to 200 units; meanwhile, plant B reduces its pollution less, going from 600 to 400 units.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p109"><p>In the end, total pollution—600 units—is the same as under the environmental standard, but total surplus is higher. That’s because the reduction in pollution has been achieved efficiently, allocating most of the reduction to plant A, the plant that can reduce emissions at lower cost. (Remember that producer surplus is the area below the supply curve and above the price line. So there is more total producer surplus in Panel (b) than in Panel (a).)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p110"><p>Panel (b) also illustrates why a system of tradable emissions permits also achieves an efficient allocation of pollution among the two plants. Assume that in the market for permits, the market price of a permit is $200 and each plant has 300 permits to start the system. Plant B, with the higher cost of pollution reduction, will buy 200 permits from Plant A, enough to allow it to emit 400 units. Correspondingly, Plant A, with the lower cost, will sell 200 of its permits to Plant B and emit only 200 units. Provided that the market price of a permit is the same as the optimal emissions tax, the two systems arrive at the same outcome.</p></div>

The goal is to set the cap low enough to generate environmental benefits, while giving polluters flexibility in meeting environmental standards and motivating them to adopt new technologies that will lower the cost of reducing pollution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p114"><p>In 1994 the United States began a cap and trade system for the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid rain by issuing permits to power plants based on their historical consumption of coal. Thanks to the system, air pollutants in the United States decreased by more than 40% from 1990 to 2008, and by 2012 acid rain levels dropped to approximately 70% of their 1980 levels. Economists who have analyzed the sulfur dioxide cap and trade system point to another reason for its success: it would have been a lot more expensive—80% more to be exact—to reduce emissions by this much using a non-market-based regulatory policy.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p115"><p>The EU cap and trade scheme, begun in 2005 and covering all 28 member nations of the European Union, is the world’s only mandatory trading system for greenhouse gases. Other countries, like Australia and New Zealand, have adopted less comprehensive schemes. China, the world’s largest carbon emitter—it burns almost as much coal as the rest of the world’s countries combined—is presently considering a national cap and trade system.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p116"><p>Yet cap and trade systems are not silver bullets for the world’s pollution problems. Although they are appropriate for pollution that’s geographically dispersed, like sulfur dioxide and greenhouse gases, they don’t work for pollution that’s localized, like groundwater contamination. And there must be vigilant monitoring of compliance for the system to work. Finally, the amount of total reduction in pollution depends on the level of the cap, a critical issue illustrated by the troubles of the EU cap and trade scheme.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch10-p117"><p>EU regulators, under industry pressure, allowed too many permits to be handed out when the system was created. By the spring of 2013 the price of a permit for a ton of greenhouse gas had fallen to 2.75 euros (about $3.70), less than a tenth of what experts believe is necessary to induce companies to switch to cleaner fuels like natural gas. The price of a permit was too low to alter polluters’ incentives and, not surprisingly, coal use in Europe boomed in 2012. Alarmed European Union legislators voted in the summer of 2013 to reduce the number of permits issued in future years in the hope of increasing the current price of a permit. There is evidence the reduction in permits has already altered polluters’ incentives. As of mid-2014, pollution throughout the EU is projected to drop by 4.4% as the price of a permit has more than doubled to 5.71 euros (about $7.34).</p></div>
