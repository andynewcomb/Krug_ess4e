<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p15"><p>In everyday conversation, people often use the word <em>money</em> to mean wealth. If you ask, “How much money does Mark Zuckerberg have?” the answer will be something like, “Oh, $30 billion or so, but who’s counting?” That is, the number will include the value of the stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets he owns.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p16"><p>But the economist’s definition of money doesn’t include all forms of wealth. The dollar bills in your wallet are money; other forms of wealth—such as cars, houses, and stock certificates—aren’t money. What, according to economists, distinguishes money from other forms of wealth?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p25"><p>Are currency and checkable bank deposits the only assets that are considered money? It depends. As we’ll see later, there are two widely used definitions of the <strong>money supply,</strong> the total value of financial assets in the economy that are considered money. The narrower definition considers only the most liquid assets to be money: currency in circulation, traveler’s checks, and checkable bank deposits. The broader definition includes these three categories plus other assets that are “almost” checkable, such as savings account deposits that can be transferred into a checking account with a phone call or a mouse click. Both definitions of the money supply, however, make a distinction between those assets that can easily be used to purchase goods and services and those that can’t.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p26"><p>Money plays a crucial role in generating <em>gains from trade</em> because it makes indirect exchange possible. Think of what happens when a cardiac surgeon buys a new refrigerator. The surgeon has valuable services to offer—namely, heart operations. The owner of the store has valuable goods to offer—refrigerators and other appliances. It would be extremely difficult for both parties if, instead of using money, they had to directly barter the goods and services they sell. In a barter system, a cardiac surgeon and an appliance store owner could trade only if the store owner happened to want a heart operation and the surgeon happened to want a new refrigerator.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p27"><p>This is known as the problem of finding a <em>double coincidence of wants:</em> in a barter system, two parties can trade only when each wants what the other has to offer. Money solves this problem: individuals can trade what they have to offer for money and trade money for what they want.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p28"><p>Because the ability to make transactions with money rather than relying on bartering makes it easier to achieve gains from trade, the existence of money increases welfare, even though money does not directly produce anything. As Adam Smith put it, money “may very properly be compared to a highway, which, while it circulates and carries to market all the grass and corn of the country, produces itself not a single pile of either.”</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p30"><p>Money plays three main roles in any modern economy: it is a <em>medium of exchange,</em> a <em>store of value,</em> and a <em>unit of account</em>.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-gl-def" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p31"><p>A <strong>medium of exchange</strong> is an asset that individuals acquire for the purpose of trading goods and services rather than for their own consumption.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p32"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>1. Medium of Exchange</strong></span> Our cardiac surgeon/refrigerator example illustrates the role of money as a <strong>medium of exchange</strong>—an asset that individuals use to trade for goods and services rather than for consumption. People can’t eat dollar bills; rather, they use dollar bills to trade for edible goods and their accompanying services.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p33"><p>In normal times, the official money of a given country—the dollar in the United States, the peso in Mexico, and so on—is also the medium of exchange in virtually all transactions in that country. During troubled economic times, however, other goods or assets often play that role instead. For example, during economic turmoil people often turn to other countries’ moneys as the medium of exchange: U.S. dollars have played this role in troubled Latin American countries, as have euros in troubled Eastern European countries.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p34"><p>In a famous example, cigarettes functioned as the medium of exchange in World War II prisoner-of-war camps: even nonsmokers traded goods and services for cigarettes because the cigarettes could in turn be easily traded for other items. During the extreme German inflation of 1923, goods such as eggs and lumps of coal briefly became mediums of exchange.</p></div>

To see why this is necessary, imagine trying to operate an economy in which ice-cream cones were the medium of exchange. Such an economy would quickly suffer from, well, monetary meltdown: your medium of exchange would often turn into a sticky puddle before you could use it to buy something else. Any asset that holds its purchasing power over time is a store of value. So the store-of-value role is a necessary but not distinctive feature of money.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p39"><p>The dollar is the most widely circulated currency. Its prominence isn’t that surprising since the United States economy is the largest in the world. The euro is a close second, behind the dollar. The combined economies of the countries using the euro, the eurozone, are about as big as the U.S. economy. And despite the fact that its economy is much smaller, Japan is closely behind the United States, largely because the Japanese make much more use of cash, as opposed to checks and credit cards, than either Europeans or Americans. Finally, China, with its rapidly growing economy, is moving up the charts, and has now passed Japan. </p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p42"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>3. Unit of Account</strong></span> Finally, money normally serves as the <strong>unit of account</strong>—the commonly accepted measure individuals use to set prices and make economic calculations. To understand the importance of this role, consider a historical fact: during the Middle Ages, peasants typically were required to provide landowners with goods and labor rather than money. A peasant might, for example, be required to work on the lord’s land one day a week and hand over one-fifth of his harvest.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p43"><p>Today, rents, like other prices, are almost always specified in money terms. That makes things much clearer: imagine how hard it would be to decide which apartment to rent if modern landlords followed medieval practice. Suppose, for example, that Mr. Smith says he’ll let you have a place if you clean his house twice a week and bring him a pound of steak every day, whereas Ms. Jones wants you to clean her house just once a week but wants four pounds of chicken every day. Who’s offering the better deal? It’s hard to say. If, instead, Smith wants $600 a month and Jones wants $700, the comparison is easy. In other words, without a commonly accepted measure, the terms of a transaction are harder to determine, making it more difficult to make transactions and achieve gains from trade.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p45"><p>In some form or another, money has been in use for thousands of years. For most of that period, people used <strong>commodity money:</strong> the medium of exchange was a good, normally gold or silver, that had intrinsic value in other uses. These alternative uses gave commodity money value independent of its role as a medium of exchange. For example, cigarettes, which served as money in World War II prisoner-of-war camps, were also valuable because many prisoners smoked. Gold was valuable because it was used for jewelry and ornamentation, aside from the fact that it was minted into coins.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p47"><p>By 1776, the year in which the United States declared independence and Adam Smith published <em>The Wealth of Nations,</em> there was widespread use of paper money in addition to gold or silver coins. Unlike modern dollar bills, however, this paper money consisted of notes issued by private banks, which promised to exchange their notes for gold or silver coins on demand. So the paper currency that initially replaced commodity money was <strong>commodity-backed money,</strong> a medium of exchange with no intrinsic value whose ultimate value was guaranteed by a promise that it could always be converted into valuable goods on demand.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p48"><p>The big advantage of commodity-backed money over simple commodity money, like gold and silver coins, was that it tied up fewer valuable resources. Although a note-issuing bank still had to keep some gold and silver on hand, it had to keep only enough to satisfy demands for redemption of its notes. And it could rely on the fact that on a normal day only a fraction of its paper notes would be redeemed. So the bank needed to keep only a portion of the total value of its notes in circulation in the form of gold and silver in its vaults. It could lend out the remaining gold and silver to those who wished to use it. This allowed society to use the remaining gold and silver for other purposes, all with no loss in the ability to achieve gains from trade.</p></div>

An actual highway provides a useful service but at a cost: land that could be used to grow crops is instead paved over. If the highway could be built through the air, it wouldn’t destroy useful land. As Smith understood, when banks replaced gold and silver money with paper notes, they accomplished a similar feat: they reduced the amount of real resources used by society to provide the functions of money.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p51"><p>At this point you may ask: why make any use at all of gold and silver in the monetary system, even to back paper money? In fact, today’s monetary system goes even further than the system Smith admired, having eliminated any role for gold and silver. A U.S. dollar bill isn’t commodity money, and it isn’t even commodity-backed. Rather, its value arises entirely from the fact that it is generally accepted as a means of payment, a role that is ultimately decreed by the U.S. government. Money whose value derives entirely from its official status as a means of exchange is known as <strong>fiat money</strong> because it exists by government fiat, a historical term for a policy declared by a ruler.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p52"><p>Fiat money has two major advantages over commodity-backed money. First, it is even more of a “waggon-way through the air”—creating it doesn’t use up any real resources beyond the paper it’s printed on. Second, the supply of money can be adjusted based on the needs of the economy, instead of being determined by the amount of gold and silver prospectors happen to discover.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p53"><p>Fiat money, though, poses some risks. We described one such risk in the opening story—counterfeiting. Counterfeiters usurp a privilege of the U.S. government, which has the sole legal right to print dollar bills. And the benefit that counterfeiters get by exchanging fake bills for real goods and services comes at the expense of the U.S. federal government, which covers a small but nontrivial part of its own expenses by issuing new currency to meet a growing demand for money. Another larger risk is that governments that can create money whenever they feel like it will be tempted to abuse the privilege.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p57"><p>By contrast, converting a stock or a bond into cash requires selling the stock or bond—something that usually takes some time and also involves paying a broker’s fee. That makes these assets much less liquid than bank deposits. So stocks and bonds, unlike bank deposits, aren’t considered money.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p59"><p>The Federal Reserve calculates the size of two <strong>monetary aggregates,</strong> overall measures of the money supply, which differ in how strictly money is defined.

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p61"><p>M1, the narrowest definition, contains only currency in circulation (also known as cash), traveler’s checks, and checkable bank deposits. M2 adds several other kinds of assets, often referred to as <strong>near-moneys</strong>—financial assets that aren’t directly usable as a medium of exchange but can be readily converted into cash or checkable bank deposits, such as savings accounts. Examples are time deposits such as small-denomination CDs, which aren’t checkable but can be withdrawn at any time before their maturity date by paying a penalty. Because currency and checkable deposits are directly usable as a medium of exchange, M1 is the most liquid measure of money.</p></div>

M1 was valued at $3,093 billion, with about 43% accounted for by currency in circulation, almost all the rest accounted for by checkable bank deposits, and a tiny slice accounted for by traveler’s checks. In turn, M1 made up 25% of M2, valued at $12,289 billion. M2 consists of M1 plus other types of assets: two types of bank deposits, known as savings deposits and time deposits, both of which are considered noncheckable, plus money market funds, which are mutual funds that invest only in liquid assets and bear a close resemblance to bank deposits. These near-moneys pay interest, although cash (currency in circulation) does not, and they typically pay higher interest rates than any offered on checkable bank deposits.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx3-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p63"><p>Alert readers may be a bit startled at one of the numbers in the money supply: more than $1 trillion of currency in circulation. That’s over $3,000 in cash for every man, woman, and child in the United States. How many people do you know who carry $3,000 in their wallets? Not many. So where is all that cash?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p64"><p>Part of the answer is that it isn’t in individuals’ wallets—it’s in cash registers. Businesses as well as individuals need to hold cash.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p65"><p>Economists believe that cash also plays an important role in transactions that people want to keep hidden. Small businesses and the self-employed sometimes prefer to be paid in cash so they can avoid paying taxes by hiding income from the Internal Revenue Service. Also, drug dealers and other criminals obviously don’t want bank records of their dealings. In fact, some analysts have tried to infer the amount of illegal activity in the economy from the total amount of cash holdings held by the public.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p66"><p>The most important reason for those huge currency holdings, however, is foreign use of dollars. The Federal Reserve estimates that 60% of U.S. currency is actually held outside the United States—largely in countries in which residents are so distrustful of their national currencies that the U.S. dollar has become a widely accepted medium of exchange.</p></div>

But American money wasn’t always like that. In the early days of European settlement, the colonies that would become the United States used commodity money, partly consisting of gold and silver coins minted in Europe. But such coins were scarce on this side of the Atlantic, so the colonists relied on a variety of other forms of commodity money. For example, settlers in Virginia used tobacco as money and settlers in the Northeast used “wampum,” a type of clamshell.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p70"><p>Later in American history, commodity-backed paper money came into widespread use. But this wasn’t paper money as we now know it, issued by the U.S. government and bearing the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury. Before the Civil War, the U.S. government didn’t issue any paper money. Instead, dollar bills were issued by private banks, which promised that their bills could be redeemed for silver coins on demand. These promises weren’t always credible because banks sometimes failed, leaving holders of their bills with worthless pieces of paper. Understandably, people were reluctant to accept currency from any bank rumored to be in financial trouble. In this private money system, some dollars were less valuable than others.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p71"><p>A curious legacy of that time was notes issued by the Citizens’ Bank of Louisiana, based in New Orleans, that became among the most widely used bank notes in the southern states. These notes were printed in English on one side and French on the other. (At the time, many people in New Orleans, originally a colony of France, spoke French.) Thus, the $10 bill read <em>Ten</em> on one side and <em>Dix,</em> the French word for “ten,” on the other. These $10 bills became known as “dixies,” probably the source of the nickname of the U.S. South. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p72"><p>The U.S. government began issuing official paper money, called “greenbacks,” in 1862 as a way to pay for the ongoing Civil War. At first greenbacks had no fixed value in terms of commodities. After 1873, the U.S. government guaranteed the value of a dollar in terms of gold, effectively turning dollars into commodity-backed money.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p73"><p>In 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt broke the link between dollars and gold, his own federal budget director—who feared that the public would lose confidence in the dollar if it wasn’t ultimately backed by gold—declared ominously, “This will be the end of Western civilization.” It wasn’t. The link between the dollar and gold was restored a few years later, then dropped again—seemingly for good—in August 1971. Despite the warnings of doom, the U.S. dollar went on to become the world’s most widely used currency. (Now it is the second-most widely used, after the euro.) </p></div>
