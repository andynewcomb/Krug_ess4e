<div data-block_type="mn-def" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p38"><p>A seller’s <strong>cost</strong> is the lowest price at which he or she is willing to sell a good.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p39"><p>The lowest price at which a potential seller is willing to sell has a special name in economics: it is called the seller’s <strong>cost</strong>. So Andrew’s cost is $5, Betty’s is $15, and so on.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_105"><p>105</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p40"><p>Using the term <em>cost</em>, which people normally associate with the monetary cost of producing a good, may sound a little strange when applied to sellers of used textbooks. The students don’t have to manufacture the books, so it doesn’t cost the student who sells a book anything to make that book available for sale, does it?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p41"><p>Yes, it does. A student who sells a book won’t have it later, as part of his or her personal collection. So there is an <em>opportunity cost</em> to selling a textbook, even if the owner has completed the course for which it was required. And remember that one of the basic principles of economics is that the true measure of the cost of doing something is always its opportunity cost. That is, the real cost of something is what you must give up to get it.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p42"><p>So it is good economics to talk of the minimum price at which someone will sell a good as the “cost” of selling that good, even if he or she doesn’t spend any money to make the good available for sale. Of course, in most real-world markets the sellers are also those who produce the good and therefore do spend money to make the good available for sale. In this case the cost of making the good available for sale <em>includes</em> monetary costs, but it may also include other opportunity costs.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p44"><p>Getting back to the example, suppose that Andrew sells his book for $30. Clearly he has gained from the transaction: he would have been willing to sell for only $5, so he has gained $25. This net gain, the difference between the price he actually gets and his cost—the minimum price at which he would have been willing to sell—is known as his <strong>individual producer surplus</strong>.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-def" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p46"><p>Economists use the term <strong>producer surplus</strong> to refer to either total or individual producer surplus.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p47"><p>As in the case of consumer surplus, we can add the individual producer surpluses of sellers to calculate the <strong>total producer surplus</strong>, the total net gain to all sellers in the market. Economists use the term <strong>producer surplus</strong> to refer to either total or individual producer surplus. <span data-type="link" data-href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-tab-2">Table 4-2</span> shows the net gain to each of the students who would sell a used book at a price of $30: $25 for Andrew, $15 for Betty, and $5 for Carlos. The total producer surplus is $25 + $15 + $5 = $45.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p48"><p>As with consumer surplus, the producer surplus gained by those who sell books can be represented graphically. Just as we derived the demand curve from the willingness to pay of different consumers, we first derive the supply curve from the cost of different producers. The step-shaped curve in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch4/KrugESS4e_fig_4_03.html">Figure 4-3</span> shows the supply curve implied by the cost shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-tab-2">Table 4-2</span>. Each step in that supply curve is one book wide and represents one seller. The height of Andrew’s step is $5, his cost. This forms the bottom of a rectangle, with $30, the price he actually receives for his book, forming the top. The area of this rectangle, ($30 − $5) × 1 = $25, is his producer surplus. So the producer surplus Andrew gains from selling his book is the <em>area of the red rectangle</em> at far left shown in the figure.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_106"><p>106</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p49"><p>Let’s assume that the campus bookstore is willing to buy all the used copies of this book that students are willing to sell at a price of $30. Then, in addition to Andrew, Betty and Carlos will also sell their books. They will also benefit from their sales, though not as much as Andrew, because they have higher costs. Andrew, as we have seen, gains $25. Betty gains a smaller amount: since her cost is $15, she gains only $15. Carlos gains even less, only $5.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p50"><p>Again, as with consumer surplus, we have a general rule for determining the total producer surplus from sales of a good: <em>The total producer surplus from sales of a good at a given price is the area above the supply curve but below that price.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch4-p51"><p>This rule applies both to examples like the one shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch4/KrugESS4e_fig_4_03.html">Figure 4-3</span>, where there are a small number of producers and a step-shaped supply curve, and to more realistic examples, where there are many producers and the supply curve is more or less smooth.</p></div>
