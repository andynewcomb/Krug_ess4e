<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p103"><p>In 1955, Americans were delighted with the nation’s prosperity. The economy was expanding, consumer goods that had been rationed during World War II were available for everyone to buy, and most Americans believed, rightly, that they were better off than the citizens of any other nation, past or present. Yet by today’s standards, Americans were quite poor in 1955. <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch12/KrugESS4e_fig_12_06.html">Figure 12-6</span> shows the percentage of American homes equipped with a variety of appliances in 1905, 1955, and 2005: in 1955 only 37% of American homes contained washing machines and hardly anyone had air conditioning. And if we turn the clock back another half-century, to 1905, we find that life for many Americans was startlingly primitive by today’s standards.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p106"><p>Part of the long-run increase in output is accounted for by the fact that we have a growing population and workforce. But the economy’s overall production has increased by much more than the population. On average, in 2013 the U.S. economy produced about $53,000 worth of goods and services per person, about twice as much as in 1972, about three times as much as in 1952, and about eight times as much as in 1900.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p107"><p>Long-run economic growth is fundamental to many of the most pressing economic questions today. Responses to key policy questions, like the country’s ability to bear the future costs of government programs such as Social Security and Medicare, depend in part on how fast the U.S. economy grows over the next few decades.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p108"><p>More broadly, the public’s sense that the country is making progress depends crucially on success in achieving long-run growth. When growth slows, as it did in the 1970s, it can help feed a national mood of pessimism. In particular, <em>long-run growth per capita—</em>a sustained upward trend in output per person—is the key to higher wages and a rising standard of living. A major concern of macroeconomics—and the theme of <span data-type="link" data-href="Chapter15.xml">Chapter 15</span>—is trying to understand the forces behind long-run growth.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p109"><p>Long-run growth is an even more urgent concern in poorer, less developed countries. In these countries, which would like to achieve a higher standard of living, the question of how to accelerate long-run growth is the central concern of economic policy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p110"><p>As we’ll see, macroeconomists don’t use the same models to think about long-run growth that they use to think about the business cycle. It’s important to keep both sets of models in mind, because what is good in the long run can be bad in the short run, and vice versa. For example, we’ve already mentioned the paradox of thrift: an attempt by households to increase their savings can cause a recession. But a higher level of savings plays a crucial role in encouraging long-run economic growth.</p></div>

One of the most informative contrasts is between Canada and Argentina, two countries that, at the beginning of the twentieth century, seemed to be in a good economic position.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p114"><p>From today’s vantage point, it’s surprising to realize that Canada and Argentina looked rather similar before World War I. Both were major exporters of agricultural products; both attracted large numbers of European immigrants; both also attracted large amounts of European investment, especially in the railroads that opened up their agricultural hinterlands. Economic historians believe that the average level of per capita income was about the same in the two countries as late as the 1930s.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p115"><p>After World War II, however, Argentina’s economy performed poorly, largely due to political instability and bad macroeconomic policies. Argentina experienced several periods of extremely high inflation, during which the cost of living soared. Meanwhile, Canada made steady progress. Thanks to the fact that Canada has achieved sustained long-run growth since 1930, but Argentina has not, Canada’s standard of living today is almost as high as that of the United States—and is about three times as high as Argentina’s.</p></div>
