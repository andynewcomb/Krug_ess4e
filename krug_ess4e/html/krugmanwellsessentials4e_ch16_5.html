<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p220"><p>We’ve just seen that the economy is self-correcting in the long run: it will eventually trend back to potential output. Most macroeconomists believe, however, that the process of self-correction typically takes a decade or more. In particular, if aggregate output is below potential output, the economy can suffer an extended period of depressed aggregate output and high unemployment before it returns to normal.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p221"><p>This belief is the background to one of the most famous quotations in economics: John Maynard Keynes’s declaration, “In the long run we are all dead” (the remark is explained in the accompanying For Inquiring Minds).</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx-3-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p222"><p>The British economist Sir John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), probably more than any other single economist, created the modern field of macroeconomics. One of his most lasting contributions was a famous quote on the meaning of the long run.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p223"><p>In 1923 Keynes published <em>A Tract on Monetary Reform,</em> a small book on the economic problems of Europe after World War I. In it he decried the tendency of many of his colleagues to focus on how things work out in the long run—as in the long-run macroeconomic equilibrium we have just analyzed—while ignoring the often very painful and possibly disastrous things that can happen along the way. Here’s a fuller version of the quote:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx-3-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p224"><p><em>This long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the sea is flat again.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-gl-def" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p225"><p><strong>Stabilization policy</strong> is the use of government policy to reduce the severity of recessions and rein in excessively strong expansions.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p226"><p>Economists usually interpret Keynes as having recommended that governments not wait for the economy to correct itself. Instead, it is argued by many economists, but not all, that the government should use monetary and fiscal policy to get the economy back to potential output in the aftermath of a shift of the aggregate demand curve. This is the rationale for an active <strong>stabilization policy,</strong> which is the use of government policy to reduce the severity of recessions and rein in excessively strong expansions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p227"><p>Can stabilization policy improve the economy’s performance? If we reexamine <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-8">Figure 16-6</span>, the answer certainly appears to be yes. Under active stabilization policy, the U.S. economy returned to potential output in 1996 after an approximately five-year recessionary gap. Likewise, in 2001 it also returned to potential output after an approximately four-year inflationary gap. These periods are much shorter than the decade or more that economists believe it would take for the economy to self-correct in the absence of active stabilization policy. However, as we’ll see shortly, the ability to improve the economy’s performance is not always guaranteed. It depends on the kinds of shocks the economy faces.</p></div>

<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-sec2-012">Policy in the Face of Demand Shocks
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p228"><p>Imagine that the economy experiences a negative demand shock, like the one shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-16">Figure 16-13</span>. As we’ve discussed, monetary and fiscal policy shift the aggregate demand curve. If policy makers react quickly to the fall in aggregate demand, they can use monetary or fiscal policy to shift the aggregate demand curve back to the right. And if policy were able to perfectly anticipate shifts of the aggregate demand curve, it could short-circuit the whole process shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-16">Figure 16-13</span>. Instead of going through a period of low aggregate output and falling prices, the government could manage the economy so that it would stay at <em>E</em><sub>1</sub>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p229"><p>Why might a policy that short-circuits the adjustment shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-16">Figure 16-13</span> and maintains the economy at its original equilibrium be desirable? For two reasons. First, the temporary fall in aggregate output that would happen without policy intervention is a bad thing, particularly because such a decline is associated with high unemployment. Second, as we explained in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch14_1.html">Chapter 14</span>, <em>price stability</em> is generally regarded as a desirable goal. So preventing deflation—a fall in the aggregate price level—is a good thing.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p230"><p>Does this mean that policy makers should always act to offset declines in aggregate demand? Not necessarily. Some policy measures to increase aggregate demand, especially those that increase budget deficits, may have long-term costs in terms of lower long-run growth. Furthermore, in the real world policy makers aren’t perfectly informed, and the effects of their policies aren’t perfectly predictable. This creates the danger that stabilization policy will do more harm than good; that is, attempts to stabilize the economy may end up creating more instability. Despite these qualifications, most economists believe that a good case can be made for using macroeconomic policy to offset major negative shocks to the <em>AD</em> curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_466"><p>466</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p231"><p>Should policy makers also try to offset positive shocks to aggregate demand? It may not seem obvious that they should. After all, even though inflation may be a bad thing, isn’t more output and lower unemployment a good thing? Not necessarily. Most economists now believe that any short-run gains from an inflationary gap must be paid back later. So policy makers today usually try to offset positive as well as negative demand shocks. For reasons we’ll explain in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch19_1.html">Chapter 19</span>, attempts to eliminate recessionary gaps and inflationary gaps usually rely on monetary rather than fiscal policy. In 2007 and 2008 the Federal Reserve sharply cut interest rates in an attempt to head off a rising recessionary gap; earlier in the decade, when the U.S. economy seemed headed for an inflationary gap, it raised interest rates to generate the opposite effect.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p232"><p>But how should macroeconomic policy respond to supply shocks?</p></div>

<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-sec2-013">Responding to Supply Shocks
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p233"><p>We’ve now come full circle to the story that began this chapter. We can now explain why FOMC committee members dread stagflation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p234"><p>In panel (a) of <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-13">Figure 16-11</span> we showed the effects of a negative supply shock: in the short run such a shock leads to lower aggregate output but a higher aggregate price level. As we’ve noted, policy makers can respond to a negative <em>demand</em> shock by using monetary and fiscal policy to return aggregate demand to its original level. But what can or should they do about a negative <em>supply</em> shock?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p235"><p>In contrast to the aggregate demand curve, there are no easy policies that shift the short-run aggregate supply curve. That is, there is no government policy that can easily affect producers’ profitability and so compensate for shifts of the short-run aggregate supply curve. So the policy response to a negative supply shock cannot aim to simply push the curve that shifted back to its original position. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p236"><p>And if you consider using monetary or fiscal policy to shift the aggregate demand curve in response to a supply shock, the right response isn’t obvious. Two bad things are happening simultaneously: a fall in aggregate output, leading to a rise in unemployment, <em>and</em> a rise in the aggregate price level. Any policy that shifts the aggregate demand curve helps one problem only by making the other worse. If the government acts to increase aggregate demand and limit the rise in unemployment, it reduces the decline in output but causes even more inflation. If it acts to reduce aggregate demand, it curbs inflation but causes a further rise in unemployment.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p237"><p>It’s a trade-off with no good answer. In the end, the United States and other economically advanced nations suffering from the supply shocks of the 1970s eventually chose to stabilize prices even at the cost of higher unemployment. But being an economic policy maker in the 1970s, or in early 2008, meant facing even harder choices than usual.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p240"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">W</span>e’ve described the theoretical rationale for stabilization policy as a way of responding to demand shocks. But does stabilization policy actually stabilize the economy? One way we might try to answer this question is to look at the long-term historical record. Before World War II, the U.S. government didn’t really have a stabilization policy, largely because macroeconomics as we know it didn’t exist, and there was no consensus about what to do. Since World War II, and especially since 1960, active stabilization policy has become standard practice.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_467"><p>467</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p241"><p>So here’s the question: has the economy actually become more stable since the government began trying to stabilize it? The answer is a qualified yes. It’s qualified for two reasons. One is that data from the pre–World War II era are less reliable than more modern data. The other is that the severe and protracted slump that began in 2007 has shaken confidence in the effectiveness of government policy. Still, there seems to have been a reduction in the size of fluctuations.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p242"><p><span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-21">Figure 16-16</span> shows the number of unemployed as a percentage of the nonfarm labor force since 1890. (We focus on nonfarm workers because farmers, though they often suffer economic hardship, are rarely reported as unemployed.) Even ignoring the huge spike in unemployment during the Great Depression, unemployment seems to have varied a lot more before World War II than after. It’s also worth noticing that the peaks in postwar unemployment, in 1975, 1982, and to some extent in 2010 (as described in the earlier Global Comparison), corresponded to major supply shocks—the kind of shock for which stabilization policy has no good answer.</p></div>
