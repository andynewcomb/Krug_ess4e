</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p127"><p>To see how banks create money, let’s examine what happens when someone decides to deposit currency in a bank. Consider the example of Silas, a miser, who keeps a shoebox full of cash under his bed. Suppose Silas realizes that it would be safer, as well as more convenient, to deposit that cash in the bank and to use his debit card when shopping. Assume that he deposits $1,000 into a checkable account at First Street Bank. What effect will Silas’s actions have on the money supply?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p128"><p>Panel (a) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch18/KrugESS4e_fig_18_04.html">Figure 18-4</span> shows the initial effect of his deposit. First Street Bank credits Silas with $1,000 in his account, so the economy’s checkable bank deposits rise by $1,000. Meanwhile, Silas’s cash goes into the vault, raising First Street’s reserves by $1,000 as well.</p></div>

<span data-type="number">Figure 18.5: </span><span data-type="caption">When Silas deposits $1,000 (which had been stashed under his bed) into a checkable bank account, there is initially no effect on the money supply: currency in circulation falls by $1,000, but checkable bank deposits rise by $1,000. The corresponding entries on the bank’s T-account, depicted in panel (a), show deposits initially rising by $1,000 and the bank’s reserves initially rising by $1,000. In the second stage, depicted in panel (b), the bank holds 10% of Silas’s deposit ($100) as reserves and lends out the rest ($900) to Maya. As a result, its reserves fall by $900 and its loans increase by $900. Its liabilities, including Silas’s $1,000 deposit, are unchanged. The money supply, the sum of checkable bank deposits and currency in circulation, has now increased by $900—the $900 now held by Maya.</span>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p129"><p>This initial transaction has no effect on the money supply. Currency in circulation, part of the money supply, falls by $1,000; checkable bank deposits, also part of the money supply, rise by the same amount.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p130"><p>But this is not the end of the story because First Street Bank can now lend out part of Silas’s deposit. Assume that it holds 10% of Silas’s deposit—$100—in reserves and lends the rest out in cash to Silas’s neighbor, Maya. The effect of this second stage is shown in panel (b). First Street’s deposits remain unchanged, and so does the value of its assets. But the composition of its assets changes: by making the loan, it reduces its reserves by $900, so that they are only $100 larger than they were before Silas made his deposit. In the place of the $900 reduction in reserves, the bank has acquired an IOU, its $900 cash loan to Maya.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_518"><p>518</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p131"><p>So by putting $900 of Silas’s cash back into circulation by lending it to Maya, First Street Bank has, in fact, increased the money supply. That is, the sum of currency in circulation and checkable bank deposits has risen by $900 compared to what it had been when Silas’s cash was still under his bed. Although Silas is still the owner of $1,000, now in the form of a checkable deposit, Maya has the use of $900 in cash from her borrowings.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p132"><p>And this may not be the end of the story. Suppose that Maya uses her cash to buy a television from Acme Merchandise. What does Anne Acme, the store’s owner, do with the cash? If she holds on to it, the money supply doesn’t increase any further. But suppose she deposits the $900 into a checkable bank deposit—say, at Second Street Bank. Second Street Bank, in turn, will keep only part of that deposit in reserves, lending out the rest, creating still more money.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p133"><p>Assume that Second Street Bank, like First Street Bank, keeps 10% of any bank deposit in reserves and lends out the rest. Then it will keep $90 in reserves and lend out $810 of Anne’s deposit to another borrower, further increasing the money supply.</p></div>

At first the money supply consists only of Silas’s $1,000. After he deposits the cash into a checkable bank deposit and the bank makes a loan, the money supply rises to $1,900. After the second deposit and the second loan, the money supply rises to $2,710. And the process will, of course, continue from there. (Although we have considered the case in which Silas places his cash in a checkable bank deposit, the results would be the same if he put it into any type of near-money.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p137"><p>In reality, some of these loaned funds may be held by borrowers in their wallets and not deposited in a bank, meaning that some of the loaned amount “leaks” out of the banking system. Such leaks reduce the size of the money multiplier, just as leaks of real income into savings reduce the size of the real GDP multiplier. (Bear in mind, however, that the leak here comes from the fact that borrowers keep some of their funds in currency, rather than the fact that consumers save some of their income.)</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p140"><p>Now suppose that for some reason a bank suddenly finds itself with $1,000 in excess reserves. What happens? The answer is that the bank will lend out that $1,000, which will end up as a checkable bank deposit somewhere in the banking system, launching a money multiplier process very similar to the process shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch18/table_18_1.html">Table 18-1</span>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p141"><p>In the first stage, the bank lends out its excess reserves of $1,000, which becomes a checkable bank deposit somewhere. The bank that receives the $1,000 deposit keeps 10%, or $100, as reserves and lends out the remaining 90%, or $900, which again becomes a checkable bank deposit somewhere. The bank receiving this $900 deposit again keeps 10%, which is $90, as reserves and lends out the remaining $810. The bank receiving this $810 keeps $81 in reserves and lends out the remaining $729, and so on. As a result of this process, the total increase in checkable bank deposits is equal to a sum that looks like:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p142"><p>$1,000 + $900 + $810 + $729 + . . . </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p143"><p>We’ll use the symbol <em>rr</em> for the reserve ratio. More generally, the total increase in checkable bank deposits that is generated when a bank lends out $1,000 in excess reserves is:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p144"><p><strong>(18-1)</strong> Increase in checkable bank deposits from $1,000 in excess reserves = $1,000 + ($1,000 × (1 − <em>rr</em>)) + ($1,000 × (1 − <em>rr</em>)<sup>2</sup>) + ($1,000× (1 − <em>rr</em>)<sup>3</sup>) + . . .</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p145"><p>An infinite series of this form can be simplified to:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p147"><p>Given a reserve ratio of 10%, or 0.1, a $1,000 increase in excess reserves will increase the total value of checkable bank deposits by $1,000/0.1 = $10,000. In fact, in a checkable-deposits-only monetary system, the total value of checkable bank deposits will be equal to the value of bank reserves divided by the reserve ratio. Or to put it a different way, if the reserve ratio is 10%, each $1 of reserves held by a bank supports $1/<em>rr</em> = $1/0.1 = $10 of checkable bank deposits.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p148"><p>In reality, the determination of the money supply is more complicated than our simple model suggests because it depends not only on the ratio of reserves to bank deposits but also on the fraction of the money supply that individuals choose to hold in the form of currency.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p150"><p>To define the money multiplier in practice, it’s important to recognize that the Federal Reserve controls the <em>sum</em> of bank reserves and currency in circulation, called the <em>monetary base,</em> but it does not control the allocation of that sum between bank reserves and currency in circulation. Consider Silas and his deposit one more time: by taking the cash from under his bed and depositing it in a bank, he reduced the quantity of currency in circulation but increased bank reserves by an equal amount—leaving the <em>monetary base,</em> on net, unchanged. The <strong>monetary base,</strong> which is the quantity the monetary authorities control, is the sum of currency in circulation and reserves held by banks.</p></div>

A $1 bill in someone’s wallet is considered money because it’s available for an individual to spend, but a $1 bill held as bank reserves in a bank vault or deposited at the Federal Reserve isn’t considered part of the money supply because it’s not available for spending. Second, checkable bank deposits, which are part of the money supply because they are available for spending, aren’t part of the monetary base.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p154"><p>Now we can formally define the <strong>money multiplier:</strong> it’s the ratio of the money supply to the monetary base. Before the financial crisis of 2008, the money multiplier was about 1.6; after the crisis it fell to about 0.7. Even before the crisis it was a lot smaller than 1/0.1 = 10, the money multiplier in a checkable-deposits-only system with a reserve ratio of 10% (the minimum required ratio for most checkable deposits in the United States).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p155"><p>The reason the actual money multiplier was so small arises from the fact that people hold significant amounts of cash, and a dollar of currency in circulation, unlike a dollar in reserves, doesn’t support multiple dollars of the money supply. In fact, before the crisis currency in circulation accounted for more than 90% of the monetary base. At the end of 2013, however, currency in circulation was less than a third of the monetary base. What had happened?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p156"><p>The answer is that the financial crisis created an abnormal situation. As explained later in this chapter, a very abnormal situation developed after Lehman Brothers, a key financial institution, failed in September 2008. Banks, seeing few opportunities for safe, profitable lending, began parking large sums at the Federal Reserve in the form of deposits—deposits that counted as part of the monetary base. As a result, currency in circulation no longer dominated the monetary base, and thanks to all those deposits at the Fed the monetary base was actually larger than M1, with the money multiplier therefore less than 1.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p159"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">I</span>n our hypothetical example illustrating how banks create money, we described Silas the miser taking the currency from under his bed and turning it into a checkable bank deposit. This led to an increase in the money supply, as banks engaged in successive waves of lending backed by Silas’s funds. It follows that if something happened to make Silas revert to old habits, taking his money out of the bank and putting it back under his bed, the result would be less lending and, ultimately, a decline in the money supply. That’s exactly what happened as a result of the bank runs of the 1930s.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch18-p160"><p><span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch18/table_18_2.html">Table 18-2</span> shows what happened between 1929 and 1933, as bank failures shook the public’s confidence in the banking system. The second column shows the public’s holdings of currency. This increased sharply, as many Americans decided that money under the bed was safer than money in the bank after all. The third column shows the value of checkable bank deposits. This fell sharply, through the multiplier process we have just analyzed, when individuals pulled their cash out of banks. Loans also fell because banks that survived the waves of bank runs increased their excess reserves, just in case another wave began. The fourth column shows the value of M1, the first of the monetary aggregates we described earlier. It fell sharply because the total reduction in checkable or near-checkable bank deposits was much larger than the increase in currency in circulation.</p></div>
