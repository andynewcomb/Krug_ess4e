<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch9-p243"><p>Many industries are <strong>oligopolies:</strong> there are only a few sellers. In particular, a <strong>duopoly</strong> has only two sellers. Oligopolies exist for more or less the same reasons that monopolies exist, but in weaker form. They are characterized by <strong>imperfect competition:</strong> firms compete but possess market power.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch9-p244"><p>Predicting the behavior of <strong>oligopolists</strong> poses something of a puzzle. The firms in an oligopoly could maximize their combined profits by acting as a <strong>cartel,</strong> setting output levels for each firm as if they were a single monopolist; to the extent that firms manage to do this, they engage in <strong>collusion.</strong> But each individual firm has an incentive to produce more than it would in such an arrangement—to engage in <strong>noncooperative behavior.</strong></p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch9-p245"><p>In order to limit the ability of oligopolists to collude and act like monopolists, most governments pursue an <strong>antitrust policy</strong> designed to make collusion more difficult. In practice, however, <strong>tacit collusion</strong> is widespread.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch9-p246"><p>A variety of factors make tacit collusion difficult: large numbers of firms, complex products and pricing, differences in interests, and bargaining power of buyers. When tacit collusion breaks down, there is a <strong>price war.</strong></p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch9-p247"><p>The situation of <strong>interdependence,</strong> in which each firm’s profit depends noticeably on what other firms do, is the subject of <strong>game theory.</strong> In the case of a game with two players, the <strong>payoff</strong> of each player depends both on its own actions and on the actions of the other; this interdependence can be represented as a <strong>payoff matrix.</strong> Depending on the structure of payoffs in the payoff matrix, a player may have a <strong>dominant strategy—</strong>an action that is always the best regardless of the other player’s actions.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch9-p248"><p><strong>Duopolists</strong> face a particular type of game known as a <strong>prisoners’ dilemma;</strong> if each acts independently in its own interest, the resulting <strong>Nash equilibrium</strong> or <strong>noncooperative equilibrium</strong> will be bad for both. However, firms that expect to play a game repeatedly tend to engage in <strong>strategic behavior,</strong> trying to influence each other’s future actions. A particular strategy that seems to work well in maintaining tacit collusion is <strong>tit for tat.</strong></p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="sum-nl" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch9-p249"><p><strong>Monopolistic competition</strong> is a market structure in which there are many competing producers, each producing a differentiated product, and there is free entry and exit in the long run. <strong>Product differentiation</strong> takes three main forms: by style or type, by location, or by quality. Products of competing sellers are considered imperfect substitutes, and each firm has its own downward-sloping demand curve and marginal revenue curve.</p></div>
