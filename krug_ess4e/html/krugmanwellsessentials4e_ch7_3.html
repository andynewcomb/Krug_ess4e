The fourth column shows marginal cost. Notice that, in this example, the marginal cost initially falls as output rises but then begins to increase. This gives the marginal cost curve the “swoosh” shape described in the Selena’s Gourmet Salsas example in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch6_1.html">Chapter 6</span>.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p80"><p>The fifth column contains the farm’s marginal revenue, which has an important feature: Noelle’s marginal revenue equal to price is constant at $18 for every output level. The sixth and final column shows the calculation of the net gain per tree, which is equal to marginal revenue minus marginal cost—or, equivalently in this case, market price minus marginal cost. As you can see, it is positive for the 10th through 50th trees; producing each of these trees raises Noelle’s profit. For the 60th through 70th trees, however, net gain is negative: producing them would decrease, not increase, profit. (You can verify this by examining <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/table_7_1.html">Table 7-1</span>.) So a quantity of 50 trees is Noelle’s profit-maximizing output; it is the level of output at which marginal cost is equal to the market price, $18.</p></div>

That is, <em>P</em> = <em>MC at the price-taking firm’s optimal quantity of output.</em> In fact, the price-taking firm’s optimal output rule is just an application of the optimal output rule to the particular case of a price-taking firm.

We will need to keep this fact in mind in future chapters, where we will learn that marginal revenue is not equal to the market price if the industry is not perfectly competitive.

This is the case in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/table_7_2.html">Table 7-2</span> at an output of 50 trees. The simpler version of the optimal output rule applies when production involves large numbers, such as hundreds or thousands of units.

No, not quite.

So what determines whether Noelle’s farm earns a profit or generates a loss?

At that quantity of output, average total cost is $14.40 per tree, indicated by point <em>Z.</em> Since the price per tree exceeds average total cost per tree, Noelle’s farm is profitable.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p112"><p>Noelle’s total profit when the market price is $18 is represented by the area of the shaded rectangle in panel (a). To see why, notice that total profit can be expressed in terms of profit per unit:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p113"><p><strong>(7-5)</strong> Profit = <em>TR</em> − <em>TC</em> = (<em>TR</em>/<em>Q</em> − <em>TC</em>/<em>Q</em>) × <em>Q</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p116"><p>since <em>P</em> is equal to <em>TR/Q</em> and <em>ATC</em> is equal to <em>TC/Q.</em> The height of the shaded rectangle in panel (a) corresponds to the vertical distance between points <em>E</em> and <em>Z.</em> It is equal to <em>P</em> − <em>ATC</em> = $18.00 − $14.40 = $3.60 per tree.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p117"><p>What about the situation illustrated in panel (b)? Here the market price of trees is $10 per tree.

This means that Noelle’s farm generates a loss, not a profit.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p118"><p>How much does she lose by producing when the market price is $10? On each tree she loses <em>ATC</em> − <em>P</em> = $14.67 − $10.00 = $4.67, an amount corresponding to the vertical distance between points <em>A</em> and <em>Y.</em> And she would produce 30 trees, which corresponds to the width of the shaded rectangle. So the total value of the losses is $4.67 × 30 = $140.00 (adjusted for rounding error), an amount that corresponds to the area of the shaded rectangle in panel (b).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p119"><p>But how does a producer know, in general, whether or not its business will be profitable? It turns out that the crucial test lies in a comparison of the market price to the producer’s <em>minimum average total cost.</em> On Noelle’s farm, minimum average total cost, which is equal to $14, occurs at an output quantity of 40 trees, indicated by point <em>C.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p120"><p>Whenever the market price exceeds minimum average total cost, the producer can find some output level for which the average total cost is less than the market price. In other words, the producer can find a level of output at which the firm makes a profit. So Noelle’s farm will be profitable whenever the market price exceeds $14. And she will achieve the highest possible profit by producing the quantity at which marginal cost equals the market price.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p121"><p>Conversely, if the market price is less than minimum average total cost, there is no output level at which price exceeds average total cost. As a result, the firm will be unprofitable at any quantity of output. As we saw, at a price of $10—an amount less than minimum average total cost—Noelle did indeed lose money. By producing the quantity at which marginal cost equals the market price, Noelle did the best she could, but the best that she could do was a loss of $140. Any other quantity would have increased the size of her loss.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p123"><p>The minimum average total cost of a price-taking firm is called its <strong>break-even price,</strong> the price at which it earns zero profit.

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p128"><p>You might be tempted to say that if a firm is unprofitable because the market price is below its minimum average total cost, it shouldn’t produce any output. In the short run, however, this conclusion isn’t right.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p129"><p>In the short run, sometimes the firm should produce even if price falls below minimum average total cost. The reason is that total cost includes <em>fixed cost</em>—cost that does not depend on the amount of output produced and can only be altered in the long run.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p130"><p>In the short run, fixed cost must still be paid, regardless of whether or not a firm produces. For example, if Noelle rents a refrigerated truck for the year, she has to pay the rent on the truck regardless of whether she produces any trees. <em>Since it cannot be changed in the short run, her fixed cost is irrelevant to her decision about whether to produce or shut down in the short run.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_213"><p>213</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p131"><p>Although fixed cost should play no role in the decision about whether to produce in the short run, other costs—variable costs—do matter. An example of variable costs is the wages of workers who must be hired to help with planting and harvesting. Variable costs can be saved by <em>not</em> producing; so they should play a role in determining whether or not to produce in the short run.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p133"><p>Because the marginal cost curve has a “swoosh” shape—falling at first before rising—the short-run average variable cost curve is U-shaped: the initial fall in marginal cost causes average variable cost to fall as well, before rising marginal cost eventually pulls it up again.

This means that the minimum average variable cost is equal to the <strong>shut-down price,</strong> the price at which the firm ceases production in the short run. In the example of Noelle’s tree farm, she will cease production in the short run by laying off workers and halting all planting and harvesting of trees.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_214"><p>214</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p140"><p>When price is greater than minimum average variable cost, however, the firm should produce in the short run. In this case, the firm maximizes profit—or minimizes loss—by choosing the output quantity at which its marginal cost is equal to the market price. For example, if the market price of each tree is $18, Noelle should produce at point <em>E</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_04.html">Figure 7-4</span>, corresponding to an output of 50 trees. Note that point <em>C</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_04.html">Figure 7-4</span> corresponds to the farm’s break-even price of $14 per tree. Since <em>E</em> lies above <em>C,</em> Noelle’s farm will be profitable; she will generate a per-tree profit of $18.00 − $14.40 = $3.60 when the market price is $18.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p141"><p>But what if the market price lies between the shut-down price and the break-even price—that is, between minimum average <em>variable</em> cost and minimum average <em>total</em> cost? In the case of Noelle’s farm, this corresponds to prices anywhere between $10 and $14—say, a market price of $12. At $12, Noelle’s farm is not profitable; since the market price is below minimum average total cost, the farm is losing the difference between price and average total cost per unit produced.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p142"><p>Yet even if it isn’t covering its total cost per unit, it is covering its variable cost per unit and some—but not all—of the fixed cost per unit. If a firm in this situation shuts down, it would incur no variable cost but would incur the <em>full</em> fixed cost. As a result, shutting down generates an even greater loss than continuing to operate.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p143"><p>This means that whenever price lies between minimum average total cost and minimum average variable cost, the firm is better off producing some output in the short run. The reason is that by producing, it can cover its variable cost per unit and at least some of its fixed cost, even though it is incurring a loss. In this case, the firm maximizes profit—that is, minimizes loss—by choosing the quantity of output at which its marginal cost is equal to the market price. So if Noelle faces a market price of $12 per tree, her profit-maximizing output is given by point <em>B</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_04.html">Figure 7-4</span>, corresponding to an output of 35 trees.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p145"><p>It’s worth noting that the decision to produce when the firm is covering its variable costs but not all of its fixed cost is similar to the decision to ignore <em>sunk costs.</em> A <strong>sunk cost</strong> is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recouped; and because it cannot be changed, it should have no effect on any current decision.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p146"><p>In the short-run production decision, fixed cost is, in effect, like a sunk cost—it has been spent, and it can’t be recovered in the short run. This comparison also illustrates why variable cost does indeed matter in the short run: it can be avoided by not producing.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p147"><p>And what happens if market price is exactly equal to the shut-down price, minimum average variable cost? In this instance, the firm is indifferent between producing 30 units or 0 units. As we’ll see shortly, this is an important point when looking at the behavior of an industry as a whole. For the sake of clarity, we’ll assume that the firm, although indifferent, does indeed produce output when price is equal to the shut-down price.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p149"><p>Putting everything together, we can now draw the <strong>short-run individual supply curve</strong> of Noelle’s farm, the red line in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/KrugESS4e_fig_7_04.html">Figure 7-4</span>; it shows how the profit-maximizing quantity of output in the short run depends on the price. As you can see, the curve is in two segments. The upward-sloping red segment starting at point <em>A</em> shows the short-run profit-maximizing output when market price is equal to or above the shut-down price of $10 per tree.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p150"><p>As long as the market price is equal to or above the shut-down price, Noelle produces the quantity of output at which marginal cost is equal to the market price. That is, at market prices equal to or above the shut-down price, the firm’s short-run supply curve corresponds to its marginal cost curve. But at any market price below minimum average variable cost—in this case, $10 per tree—the firm shuts down and output drops to zero in the short run. This corresponds to the vertical segment of the curve that lies on top of the vertical axis.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p151"><p>Do firms really shut down temporarily without going out of business? Yes. In fact, in some businesses temporary shut-downs are routine. The most common examples are industries in which demand is highly seasonal, like outdoor amusement parks in climates with cold winters. Such parks would have to offer very low prices to entice customers during the colder months—prices so low that the owners would not cover their variable costs (principally wages and electricity). The wiser choice economically is to shut down until warm weather brings enough customers who are willing to pay a higher price.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p152"><p>Although fixed cost cannot be altered in the short run, in the long run firms can acquire or get rid of machines, buildings, and so on. As we learned in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch6_1.html">Chapter 6</span>, in the long run the level of fixed cost is a matter of choice. There we saw that a firm will choose the level of fixed cost that minimizes the average total cost for its desired output quantity. Now we will focus on an even bigger question facing a firm when choosing its fixed cost: whether to incur <em>any</em> fixed cost at all by remaining in its current business.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p153"><p>In the long run, a producer can always eliminate fixed cost by selling off its plant and equipment. If it does so, of course, it can’t ever produce—it has exited the industry. In contrast, a potential producer can take on some fixed cost by acquiring machines and other resources, which puts it in a position to produce—it can enter the industry. In most perfectly competitive industries the set of producers, although fixed in the short run, changes in the long run as firms enter or exit the industry.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p154"><p>Consider Noelle’s farm once again. To simplify our analysis, we will sidestep the problem of choosing among several possible levels of fixed cost. Instead, we will assume from now on that Noelle has only one possible choice of fixed cost if she operates, the amount of $140, her minimum average total cost, that was the basis for the calculations in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/table_7_1.html">Tables 7-1</span>, <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/table_7_2.html">7-2</span>, and <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch7/table_7_3.html">7-3</span>. (With this assumption, Noelle’s short-run average total cost curve and long-run average total cost curve are one and the same.) Alternatively, she can choose a fixed cost of zero if she exits the industry.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p155"><p>Suppose that the market price of trees is consistently less than $14 over an extended period of time. In that case, Noelle never fully covers her fixed cost: her business runs at a persistent loss. In the long run, then, she can do better by closing her business and leaving the industry. In other words, <em>in the long run</em> firms will exit an industry if the market price is consistently less than their break-even price—their minimum average total cost.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p156"><p>Conversely, suppose that the price of Christmas trees is consistently above the break-even price, $14, for an extended period of time. Because her farm is profitable, Noelle will remain in the industry and continue producing.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p157"><p>But things won’t stop there. The Christmas tree industry meets the criterion of <em>free entry:</em> there are many potential tree producers because the necessary inputs are easy to obtain. And the cost curves of those potential producers are likely to be similar to those of Noelle, since the technology used by other producers is likely to be very similar to that used by Noelle. If the price is high enough to generate profits for existing producers, it will also attract some of these potential producers into the industry. So <em>in the long run</em> a price in excess of $14 should lead to entry: new producers will come into the Christmas tree industry.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p158"><p>As we will see next, exit and entry lead to an important distinction between the <em>short-run industry supply curve</em> and the <em>long-run industry supply curve.</em></p></div>

Unsurprisingly, the demand for corn skyrocketed, along with its price. In 2012, American farmers received an average price per bushel of about $7 to $8, compared to less than $2 in 2005. Being smart profit-maximizers, these farmers responded by planting more corn and less of other crops such as cotton. By 2013, they delivered five straight years of increases in acreage planted in corn.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p163"><p>If this sounds like a sure way to make a profit, think again. Corn farmers were taking a considerable gamble by planting more corn as their costs went up. Consider fertilizer, an important input. Corn requires more fertilizer than other crops, and with more farmers planting corn, the increased demand for fertilizer led to a price increase. In 2006 and 2007, fertilizer prices surged to five times their 2005 level; by 2013 prices were twice as high.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p164"><p>The pull of higher corn prices also lifted the price of farmland so high that by 2013 there was talk of a bubble in farmland prices. Remember that even if a farmer owns land outright, that farmer still incurs an opportunity cost when planting rather than leasing or selling it. In the decade preceding 2013, the average price of an acre of farmland rose almost 300%.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p165"><p>Despite the risk and increase in costs, what corn farmers did made complete economic sense. By planting more corn, each farmer moved up his or her individual supply curve. And because the individual supply curve is the marginal cost curve, each farmer’s costs also went up because of the need to use more inputs that had become more expensive to obtain.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch7-p166"><p>So the moral of the story is that farmers will increase their corn acreage until the marginal cost of producing corn is approximately equal to the market price of corn—which shouldn’t come as a surprise, because corn production satisfies all the requirements of a perfectly competitive industry.</p></div>
