<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p58"><p>In this chapter’s opening story, we described how China passed Japan as the world’s second-largest economy in 2010. At the time, Japan’s economy was weakening: during the second quarter of 2010, output declined by an annual rate of 6.3%. Oddly, however, GDP was up. In fact, Japan’s GDP measured in yen, its national currency, rose by an annual rate of 4.8% during the quarter. How was that possible? The answer is that Japan was experiencing inflation at the time. As a result, the yen value of Japan’s GDP rose although output actually fell.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p59"><p>The moral of this story is that the commonly cited GDP number is an interesting and useful statistic, one that provides a good way to compare the size of different economies, but it’s not a good measure of the economy’s growth over time. GDP can grow because the economy grows, but it can also grow simply because of inflation. Even if an economy’s output doesn’t change, GDP will go up if the prices of the goods and services the economy produces have increased. Likewise, GDP can fall either because the economy is producing less or because prices have fallen.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p61"><p>To accurately measure the economy’s growth, we need a measure of <strong>aggregate output:</strong> the total quantity of final goods and services the economy produces. The measure that is used for this purpose is known as <em>real GDP.</em> By tracking real GDP over time, we avoid the problem of changes in prices distorting the value of changes in production of goods and services over time. So, how is real GDP calculated and what does it mean?</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p62"><p>To understand how real GDP is calculated, imagine an economy in which only two goods, apples and oranges, are produced and in which both goods are sold only to final consumers. The outputs and prices of the two fruits for two consecutive years are shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-tab-1">Table 13-1</span>. We can see from the data that the value of sales increased from year 1 to year 2. In the first year, the total value of sales was (2,000 billion × $0.25) + (1,000 billion × $0.50) = $1,000 billion; in the second it was (2,200 billion × $0.30) + (1,200 billion × $0.70) = $1,500 billion, which is 50% larger. But it is also clear from the table that this increase in the dollar value of GDP overstates the real growth in the economy. Although the quantities of both apples and oranges increased, the prices of both apples and oranges also rose. So part of the 50% increase in the dollar value of GDP from year 1 to year 2 simply reflects higher prices, not higher production of output.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p63"><p>To estimate the true increase in aggregate output produced, we have to ask the following question: how much would GDP have gone up if prices had <em>not</em> changed? To answer this question, we need to find the value of output in year 2 expressed in year 1 prices. In year 1 the price of apples was $0.25 each and the price of oranges $0.50 each. So year 2 output <em>at year 1 prices</em> is (2,200 billion × $0.25) + (1,200 billion × $0.50) = $1,150 billion. And output in year 1 at year 1 prices was $1,000 billion. So in this example GDP measured in year 1 prices rose 15%—from $1,000 billion to $1,150 billion.</p></div>

Economists call this measure <strong>nominal GDP,</strong> GDP at current prices. If we had used nominal GDP to measure the true change in output from year 1 to year 2 in our apples and oranges example, we would have overstated the true growth in output: we would have claimed it to be 50%, when in fact it was only 15%. By comparing output in the two years using a common set of prices—the year 1 prices in this example—we are able to focus solely on changes in the quantity of output by eliminating the influence of changes in prices.</p></div>

But real GDP in 2005 expressed in 2009 dollars was higher than nominal GDP in 2005, reflecting the fact that prices were in general higher in 2009 than in 2005. Real GDP in 2013 expressed in 2009 dollars, however, was less than nominal GDP in 2013 because prices in 2009 were lower than in 2013. </p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p69"><p>There is an alternative way to calculate real GDP using the data in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-tab-1">Table 13-1</span>. Why not measure it using the prices of year 2 rather than year 1 as the base-year prices? This procedure seems equally valid. According to that calculation, real GDP in year 1 at year 2 prices is (2,000 billion × $0.30) + (1,000 billion × $0.70) = $1,300 billion; real GDP in year 2 at year 2 prices is $1,500 billion, the same as nominal GDP in year 2. So using year 2 prices as the base year, the growth rate of real GDP is equal to ($1,500 billion − $1,300 billion)/$1,300 billion = 0.154, or 15.4%. This is slightly higher than the figure we got from the previous calculation, in which year 1 prices were the base-year prices. In that calculation, we found that real GDP increased by 15%. Neither answer, 15.4% versus 15%, is more “correct” than the other.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p73"><p>GDP, nominal or real, is a measure of a country’s aggregate output. Other things equal, a country with a larger population will have higher GDP simply because there are more people working. So if we want to compare GDP across countries but want to eliminate the effect of differences in population size, we use the measure <strong>GDP per capita—</strong>GDP divided by the size of the population, equivalent to the average GDP per person.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p74"><p>Real GDP per capita can be a useful measure in some circumstances, such as in a comparison of labor productivity between countries. However, despite the fact that it is a rough measure of the average real output per person, real GDP per capita has well-known limitations as a measure of a country’s living standards. Every once in a while economists are accused of believing that growth in real GDP per capita is the only thing that matters—that is, thinking that increasing real GDP per capita is a goal in itself. In fact, economists rarely make that mistake; the idea that economists care only about real GDP per capita is a sort of urban legend. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p75"><p>Let’s take a moment to be clear about why a country’s real GDP per capita is not a sufficient measure of human welfare in that country and why growth in real GDP per capita is not an appropriate policy goal in itself.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p76"><p>One way to think about this issue is to say that an increase in real GDP means an expansion in the economy’s production possibility frontier. Because the economy has increased its productive capacity, society can achieve more things. But whether society actually makes good use of that increased potential to improve living standards is another matter. To put it in a slightly different way, your income may be higher this year than last year, but whether you use that higher income to improve your quality of life is your choice.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch13-p77"><p>So let’s say it again: real GDP per capita is a measure of an economy’s average aggregate output per person—and so of what it <em>can</em> do. It is not a sufficient goal in itself because it doesn’t address how a country uses that output to affect living standards. A country with a high GDP can afford to be healthy, to be well educated, and in general to have a good quality of life. But there is not a one-to-one match between GDP and the quality of life.</p></div>
