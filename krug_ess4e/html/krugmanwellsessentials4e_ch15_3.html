<div data-block_type="mn-gl-def" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p53"><p><strong>Labor productivity,</strong> often referred to simply as <strong>productivity,</strong> is output per worker.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p54"><p><em>Sustained economic growth occurs only when the amount of output produced by the average worker increases steadily.</em> The term <strong>labor productivity,</strong> or <strong>productivity</strong> for short, is used to refer either to output per worker or, in some cases, to output per hour. (The number of hours worked by an average worker differs to some extent across countries, although this isn’t an important factor in the difference between living standards in, say, India and the United States.) In this book we’ll focus on output per worker. For the economy as a whole, productivity—output per worker—is simply real GDP divided by the number of people working.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p55"><p>You might wonder why we say that higher productivity is the only source of long-run growth. Can’t an economy also increase its real GDP per capita by putting more of the population to work? The answer is, yes, but . . . . For short periods of time, an economy can experience a burst of growth in output per capita by putting a higher percentage of the population to work. That happened in the United States during World War II, when millions of women who previously worked only in the home entered the paid workforce. The percentage of adult civilians employed outside the home rose from 50% in 1941 to 58% in 1944, and you can see the resulting bump in real GDP per capita during those years in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-fig-2">Figure 15-1</span>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p56"><p>Over the longer run, however, the rate of employment growth is never very different from the rate of population growth. Over the course of the twentieth century, for example, the population of the United States rose at an average rate of 1.3% per year and employment rose 1.5% per year. Real GDP per capita rose 1.9% per year; of that, 1.7%—that is, almost 90% of the total—was the result of rising productivity. In general, overall real GDP can grow because of population growth, but any large increase in real GDP <em>per capita</em> must be the result of increased output <em>per worker.</em> That is, it must be due to higher productivity.</p></div>

First, the modern worker has far more <em>physical capital,</em> such as machinery and office space, to work with.

It’s important to realize that economically important technological progress need not be flashy or rely on cutting-edge science. Historians have noted that past economic growth has been driven not only by major inventions, such as the railroad or the semiconductor chip, but also by thousands of modest innovations, such as the Post-it<sup>®</sup> note, introduced in 1981, which has had surprisingly large benefits for office productivity. Experts attribute much of the productivity surge that took place in the United States late in the twentieth century to new technology adopted by service-producing companies like Walmart rather than to high-technology companies.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p79"><p>To see why the relationship between physical capital per worker and productivity exhibits diminishing returns, think about how having farm equipment affects the productivity of farmworkers. A little bit of equipment makes a big difference: a worker equipped with a tractor can do much more than a worker without one. And a worker using more expensive equipment will, other things equal, be more productive: a worker with a $40,000 tractor will normally be able to cultivate more farmland in a given amount of time than a worker with a $20,000 tractor because the more expensive machine will be more powerful, perform more tasks, or both.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p80"><p>But will a worker with a $40,000 tractor, holding human capital and technology constant, be twice as productive as a worker with a $20,000 tractor? Probably not: there’s a huge difference between not having a tractor at all and having even an inexpensive tractor; there’s much less difference between having an inexpensive tractor and having a better tractor. And we can be sure that a worker with a $200,000 tractor won’t be 10 times as productive: a tractor can be improved only so much. Because the same is true of other kinds of equipment, the aggregate production function shows diminishing returns to physical capital.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p81"><p>Diminishing returns to physical capital imply a relationship between physical capital per worker and output per worker like the one shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-fig-7">Figure 15-4</span>. As the productivity curve for physical capital and the accompanying table illustrate, more physical capital per worker leads to more output per worker. But each $20,000 increment in physical capital per worker adds less to productivity. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p82"><p>As you can see from the table, there is a big payoff for the first $20,000 of physical capital: real GDP per worker rises by $30,000. The second $20,000 of physical capital also raises productivity, but not by as much: real GDP per worker goes up by only $20,000. The third $20,000 of physical capital raises real GDP per worker by only $10,000. By comparing points along the curve you can also see that as physical capital per worker rises, output per worker also rises—but at a diminishing rate. Going from the origin at 0 to point <em>A,</em> a $20,000 increase in physical capital per worker, leads to an increase of $30,000 in real GDP per worker. Going from point <em>A</em> to point <em>B,</em> a second $20,000 increase in physical capital per worker, leads to an increase of only $20,000 in real GDP per worker. And from point <em>B</em> to point <em>C,</em> a $20,000 increase in physical capital per worker increased real GDP per worker by only $10,000.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p83"><p>It’s important to realize that diminishing returns to physical capital is an “other things equal” phenomenon: additional amounts of physical capital are less productive <em>when the amount of human capital per worker and the technology are held fixed.</em> Diminishing returns may disappear if we increase the amount of human capital per worker, or improve the technology, or both at the same time the amount of physical capital per worker is increased.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p84"><p>For example, a worker with a $40,000 tractor who has also been trained in the most advanced cultivation techniques may in fact be more than twice as productive as a worker with only a $20,000 tractor and no additional human capital. But diminishing returns to any one input—regardless of whether it is physical capital, human capital, or number of workers—is a pervasive characteristic of production. Typical estimates suggest that in practice a 1% increase in the quantity of physical capital per worker increases output per worker by only one-third of 1%, or 0.33%. </p></div>

A similar but more complex procedure is used to estimate the effects of growing human capital. The procedure is more complex because there aren’t simple dollar measures of the quantity of human capital.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p90"><p>Growth accounting allows us to calculate the effects of greater physical and human capital on economic growth. But how can we estimate the effects of technological progress? We do so by estimating what is left over after the effects of physical and human capital have been taken into account. For example, let’s imagine that there was no increase in human capital per worker so that we can focus on changes in physical capital and in technology.</p></div>

Let’s assume that this was the relationship given the technology available in 1940.

(We’ve chosen a 70-year stretch to allow us to use the Rule of 70.) The 2010 curve is shifted up compared to the 1940 curve because technologies developed over the previous 70 years make it possible to produce more output for a given amount of physical capital per worker than was possible with the technology available in 1940.

If this increase in physical capital per worker had taken place without any technological progress, the economy would have moved from <em>A</em> to <em>C:</em> output per worker would have risen, but only from $30,000 to $60,000, or 1% per year (using the Rule of 70 tells us that a 1% growth rate over 70 years doubles output). In fact, however, the economy moved from <em>A</em> to <em>D:</em> output rose from $30,000 to $120,000, or 2% per year. There was an increase in both physical capital per worker and technological progress, which shifted the aggregate production function.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p94"><p>In this case, 50% of the annual 2% increase in productivity—that is, 1% in annual productivity growth—is due to higher <strong>total factor productivity,</strong> the amount of output that can be produced with a given amount of factor inputs. So when total factor productivity increases, the economy can produce more output with the same quantity of physical capital, human capital, and labor.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p95"><p>Most estimates find that increases in total factor productivity are central to a country’s economic growth. We believe that observed increases in total factor productivity in fact measure the economic effects of technological progress. All of this implies that technological change is crucial to economic growth. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p96"><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the growth rate of both labor productivity and total factor productivity for nonfarm business in the United States. According to the Bureau’s estimates, over the period from 1948 to 2010 American labor productivity rose 2.3% per year. Only 49% of that rise is explained by increases in physical and human capital per worker; the rest is explained by rising total factor productivity—that is, by technological progress.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p97"><p>Natural resources have an effect on productivity. Other things equal, countries that are abundant in valuable natural resources, such as highly fertile land or rich mineral deposits, have higher real GDP per capita than less fortunate countries. The most obvious modern example is the Middle East, where enormous oil deposits have made a few sparsely populated countries very rich. For example, Kuwait has about the same level of real GDP per capita as Germany, but Kuwait’s wealth is based on oil, not manufacturing, the source of Germany’s high output per worker.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p98"><p>But other things are often not equal. In the modern world, natural resources are a much less important determinant of productivity than human or physical capital for the great majority of countries. For example, some nations with very high real GDP per capita, such as Japan, have very few natural resources. Some resource-rich nations, such as Nigeria (which has sizable oil deposits), are very poor.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p99"><p>Historically, natural resources played a much more prominent role in determining productivity. In the nineteenth century, the countries with the highest real GDP per capita were those abundant in rich farmland and mineral deposits: the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Australia. As a consequence, natural resources figured prominently in the development of economic thought. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p100"><p>In a famous book published in 1798, <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population,</em> the English economist Thomas Malthus made the fixed quantity of land in the world the basis of a pessimistic prediction about future productivity. As population grew, he pointed out, the amount of land per worker would decline. And this, other things equal, would cause productivity to fall.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p101"><p>His view, in fact, was that improvements in technology or increases in physical capital would lead only to temporary improvements in productivity because they would always be offset by the pressure of rising population and more workers on the supply of land. In the long run, he concluded, the great majority of people were condemned to living on the edge of starvation. Only then would death rates be high enough and birth rates low enough to prevent rapid population growth from outstripping productivity growth.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p102"><p>It hasn’t turned out that way, although many historians believe that Malthus’s prediction of falling or stagnant productivity was valid for much of human history. Population pressure probably did prevent large productivity increases until the eighteenth century. But in the time since Malthus wrote his book, any negative effects on productivity from population growth have been far outweighed by other, positive factors—advances in technology, increases in human and physical capital, and the opening up of enormous amounts of cultivable land in the New World.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p103"><p>It remains true, however, that we live on a finite planet, with limited supplies of resources such as oil and limited ability to absorb environmental damage. We address the concerns these limitations pose for economic growth in the final section of this chapter.</p></div>

Technological innovation continues, of course. But Gordon made the case that the payoff from recent innovations will be limited, especially compared with the great innovations of the past.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p107"><p>Gordon made his case, in part, by contrasting recent innovations—which have mainly centered around information technology, from computers and smartphones to the internet—with the great innovations that took place in the late-nineteenth century. He argued that these late-nineteenth-century innovations, often described as the “Second Industrial Revolution,” continued to drive growth for most of the twentieth century. According to Gordon, there were five big innovations:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p114"><p>Gordon also argues that the numbers bear him out. <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-fig-9">Figure 15-6</span> illustrates his argument. The blue and red lines show the historical rate of growth of real GDP per capita in the world’s “technological leaders”—Britain (red) before 1906, the United States (blue) thereafter. The green line shows a “smoothed” version of this history, which Gordon sees as a huge but temporary hump, and then extrapolates this pattern forward. As he says, growth rates got higher and higher until around the 1950s, but have fallen since then—and he argues that they will keep on falling, and that growth will eventually come to a virtual halt.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch15-p115"><p>Is Gordon right? The most persuasive counterargument says that we have only just begun to see the payoff of modern technologies. As a recent book by MIT’s Eric Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, <em>Race Against the Machine,</em> points out, in the past few years innovative technologies addressing a number of seemingly intractable problems have reached the state where they’re either already on the market or ready to go—these include useful speech recognition, machine translation, self-driving vehicles, and more. So you can make the case that we are on the cusp of truly transformative technological change right now.</p></div>

As Yogi Berra said, “It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.” What’s clear, however, is that both sides are asking the right question, because technology is, ultimately, the main driver of long-run economic growth.</p></div>
