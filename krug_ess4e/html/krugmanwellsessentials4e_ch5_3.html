<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p074"><p>In a true emergency, a patient is unlikely to question the price of the ambulance ride to the hospital. But even in a non-emergency, like Kira’s broken teeth, patients are often unlikely to respond to an increase in the price of an ambulance by reducing their demand, because they are unaware of the cost. As a result, investors in private ambulance companies see profit-making opportunities in delivering ambulance services, because the price elasticity of demand is small. But what does that mean? How low does a price elasticity have to be for us to classify it as low? How big does it have to be for us to consider it high? And what determines whether the price elasticity of demand is high or low anyway?</p></div>

The quantity of snake anti-venom demanded is always 1,000 doses, regardless of price. As a result, the price elasticity of demand is zero—the quantity demanded is unaffected by the price. Panel (b) shows a perfectly elastic demand curve, which is a horizontal line. At a price of $5, consumers will buy any quantity of pink tennis balls, but they will buy none at a price above $5. If the price falls below $5, they will buy an extremely large number of pink tennis balls and none of any other color.

In this case, consumers will buy no pink balls if they cost more than $5 per dozen but will buy only pink balls if they cost less than $5. The demand curve will therefore be a horizontal line at a price of $5 per dozen balls. As you move back and forth along this line, there is a change in the quantity demanded but no change in the price. Roughly speaking, when you divide a number by zero, you get infinity, denoted by the symbol ∞. So a horizontal demand curve implies an infinite price elasticity of demand. When the price elasticity of demand is infinite, economists say that demand is <strong>perfectly elastic.</strong></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p084"><p>The price elasticity of demand for the vast majority of goods is somewhere between these two extreme cases. Economists use one main criterion for classifying these intermediate cases: they ask whether the price elasticity of demand is greater or less than 1. When the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, economists say that demand is <strong>elastic.</strong> When the price elasticity of demand is less than 1, they say that demand is <strong>inelastic.</strong> The borderline case is <strong>unit-elastic demand,</strong> where the price elasticity of demand is—surprise—exactly 1.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p085"><p>To see why a price elasticity of demand equal to 1 is a useful dividing line, let’s consider a hypothetical example: a toll bridge operated by the state highway department. Other things equal, the number of drivers who use the bridge depends on the toll, the price the highway department charges for crossing the bridge: the higher the toll, the fewer the drivers who use the bridge.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p086"><p><span data-type="link" data-href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch5-fig-005">Figure 5-3</span> shows three hypothetical demand curves—one in which demand is unit-elastic, one in which it is inelastic, and one in which it is elastic. In each case, point <em>A</em> shows the quantity demanded if the toll is $0.90 and point <em>B</em> shows the quantity demanded if the toll is $1.10. An increase in the toll from $0.90 to $1.10 is an increase of 20% if we use the midpoint method to calculate percent changes.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p087"><p>Panel (a) shows what happens when the toll is raised from $0.90 to $1.10 and the demand curve is unit-elastic. Here the 20% price rise leads to a fall in the quantity of cars using the bridge each day from 1,100 to 900, which is a 20% decline (again using the midpoint method). So the price elasticity of demand is 20%/20% = 1.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p088"><p>Panel (b) shows a case of inelastic demand when the toll is raised from $0.90 to $1.10. The same 20% price rise reduces the quantity demanded from 1,050 to 950. That’s only a 10% decline, so in this case the price elasticity of demand is 10%/20% = 0.5.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p089"><p>Panel (c) shows a case of elastic demand when the toll is raised from $0.90 to $1.10.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p090"><p>Why does it matter whether demand is unit-elastic, inelastic, or elastic? Because this classification predicts how changes in the price of a good will affect the <em>total revenue</em> earned by producers from the sale of that good. In many real-life situations, it is crucial to know how price changes affect total revenue. <strong>Total revenue</strong> is defined as the total value of sales of a good or service, equal to the price multiplied by the quantity sold.</p></div>

We see that 1,100 drivers will use the bridge if the toll is $0.90. So the total revenue at a price of $0.90 is $0.90 × 1,100 = $990. This value is equal to the area of the green rectangle, which is drawn with the bottom left corner at the point (0, 0) and the top right corner at (1,100, 0.90). In general, the total revenue at any given price is equal to the area of a rectangle whose height is the price and whose width is the quantity demanded at that price.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p093"><p>To get an idea of why total revenue is important, consider the following scenario. Suppose that the toll on the bridge is currently $0.90 but that the highway department must raise extra money for road repairs. One way to do this is to raise the toll on the bridge. But this plan might backfire, since a higher toll will reduce the number of drivers who use the bridge. And if traffic on the bridge dropped a lot, a higher toll would actually reduce total revenue instead of increasing it. So it’s important for the highway department to know how drivers will respond to a toll increase.</p></div>

At a toll of $0.90, total revenue is given by the sum of the areas <em>A</em> and <em>B.</em> After the toll is raised to $1.10, total revenue is given by the sum of areas <em>B</em> and <em>C.</em> So when the toll is raised, revenue represented by area <em>A</em> is lost but revenue represented by area <em>C</em> is gained.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p008"><p><em>A price effect:</em> After a price increase, each unit sold sells at a higher price, which tends to raise revenue.</p></div>

The answer is that, in general, the effect on total revenue can go either way—a price rise may either increase total revenue or lower it. If the price effect, which tends to raise total revenue, is the stronger of the two effects, then total revenue goes up. If the quantity effect, which tends to reduce total revenue, is the stronger, then total revenue goes down. And if the strengths of the two effects are exactly equal—as in our toll bridge example, where a $180 gain offsets a $180 loss—total revenue is unchanged by the price increase.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0101"><p>The price elasticity of demand tells us what happens to total revenue when price changes: its size determines which effect—the price effect or the quantity effect—is stronger. Specifically:</p></div>

An increase in the price from $0.90 to $1.10 leaves total revenue unchanged at $990 when demand is unit-elastic. When demand is inelastic, the quantity effect is dominated by the price effect; the same price increase leads to an increase in total revenue from $945 to $1,045.

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0111"><p>Suppose an economist says that “the price elasticity of demand for coffee is 0.25.” What he or she means is that <em>at the current price</em> the elasticity is 0.25. In the previous discussion of the toll bridge, what we were really describing was the elasticity <em>at the price</em> of $0.90. Why this qualification? Because for the vast majority of demand curves, the price elasticity of demand at one point along the curve is different from the price elasticity of demand at other points along the same curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0112"><p>To see this, consider the table in <span data-type="link" data-href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch5-fig-008">Figure 5-5</span>, which shows a hypothetical demand schedule. It also shows in the last column the total revenue generated at each price and quantity combination in the demand schedule. The upper panel of the graph in <span data-type="link" data-href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch5-fig-008">Figure 5-5</span> shows the corresponding demand curve. The lower panel illustrates the same data on total revenue: the height of a bar at each quantity demanded—which corresponds to a particular price—measures the total revenue generated at that price.</p></div>

This means that when the price is low, demand is inelastic. Moreover, you can see that demand is inelastic on the entire section of the demand curve from a price of $0 to a price of $5.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0116"><p>Investors in private ambulance companies believe that the price elasticity of demand for an ambulance ride is low for two important reasons. First, in many if not most cases, an ambulance ride is a medical necessity. Second, in an emergency there really is no substitute for the standard of care that an ambulance provides. And even among ambulances there are typically no substitutes because in any given geographical area there is usually only one ambulance provider. (The exceptions are very densely populated areas, but even in those locations an ambulance dispatcher is unlikely to give you a choice of ambulance providers with an accompanying price list.)</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0117"><p>In general there are four main factors that determine elasticity: whether a good is a necessity or luxury, the availability of close substitutes, the share of income a consumer spends on the good, and how much time has elapsed since a change in price. We’ll briefly examine each of these factors.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0118"><p><strong>Whether the Good Is a Necessity or a Luxury</strong> As our opening story illustrates, the price elasticity of demand tends to be low if a good is something you must have, like a life-saving ambulance ride to the hospital. The price elasticity of demand tends to be high if the good is a luxury—something you can easily live without. For example, most people would consider a 110-inch high-definition TV a luxury—nice to have, but something they can live without. Therefore, the price elasticity of demand for it will be much higher than for a life-saving ambulance ride to the hospital.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0119"><p><strong>The Availability of Close Substitutes</strong> As we just noted, the price elasticity of demand tends to be low if there are no close substitutes or if they are very difficult to obtain. In contrast, the price elasticity of demand tends to be high if there are other readily available goods that consumers regard as similar and would be willing to consume instead. For example, most consumers believe that there are fairly close substitutes to their favorite brand of breakfast cereal. As a result, if the maker of a particular brand of breakfast cereal raised the price significantly, that maker is likely to lose much—if not all—of its sales to other brands for which the price has not risen.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0120"><p><strong>Share of Income Spent on the Good</strong> Consider a good that some people consume frequently, such as gasoline—say, for a long commute to and from work every day. For these consumers, spending on gasoline will typically absorb a significant share of their income. As a result, when the price of gasoline goes up, these consumers are likely to be very responsive to the price change and have a higher elasticity of demand. Why? Because when the good absorbs a significant share of these consumers’ income, it is worth their time and effort to find a way to reduce their demand when the price goes up—such as switching to carpooling instead of driving alone. In contrast, people who consume gasoline infrequently—for example, people who walk to work or take the bus—will have a low share of income spent on gasoline and therefore a lower elasticity of demand.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_149"><p>149</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0121"><p><strong>Time Elapsed Since Price Change</strong> In general, the price elasticity of demand tends to increase as consumers have more time to adjust. This means that the long-run price elasticity of demand is often higher than the short-run elasticity.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0122"><p>A good illustration is the changes in Americans’ behavior over the past decade in response to higher gasoline prices. In 1998, a gallon of gasoline was only about $1. Over the years, however, gasoline prices steadily rose, so by early 2013 a gallon of gas cost from $3.50 to $4.00 in much of the United States. Over time, however, people changed their habits and choices in ways that enabled them to gradually reduce their gasoline consumption. In a recent survey, 53% of responders said they had made major life changes in order to cope with higher gas prices—changes such as driving less, getting a more fuel-efficient car, and using other modes of transportation like buses or bicycles. Some even moved to a more convenient location to save gas. These changes are reflected in the data on American gasoline consumption: the trend line of consumption fluctuated until about 2003, then took a nosedive. So by 2013, Americans were purchasing 30 million gallons of gasoline a day on average, less than half of the 64 million they purchased in 2003. This confirms that the long-run price elasticity of demand for gasoline was indeed much larger than the short-run elasticity.</p></div>

Tuition has been rising faster than the overall cost of living for years. But does rising tuition keep people from going to college? Two studies found that the answer depends on the type of college. Both studies assessed how responsive the decision to go to college is to a change in tuition.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0126"><p>A 1988 study found that a 3% increase in tuition led to an approximately 2% fall in the number of students enrolled at four-year institutions, giving a price elasticity of demand of 0.67 (2%/3%). In the case of two-year institutions, the study found a significantly higher response: a 3% increase in tuition led to a 2.7% fall in enrollments, giving a price elasticity of demand of 0.9. In other words, the enrollment decision for students at two-year colleges was significantly more responsive to price than for students at four-year colleges. The result: students at two-year colleges are more likely to forgo getting a degree because of tuition costs than students at four-year colleges.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0127"><p>A 1999 study confirmed this pattern. In comparison to four-year colleges, it found that two-year college enrollment rates were significantly more responsive to changes in state financial aid (a decline in aid leading to a decline in enrollments), a predictable effect given these students’ greater sensitivity to the cost of tuition. Another piece of evidence suggests that students at two-year colleges are more likely to be paying their own way and making a trade-off between attending college versus working: the study found that enrollments at two-year colleges are much more responsive to changes in the unemployment rate (an increase in the unemployment rate leading to an increase in enrollments) than enrollments at four-year colleges. So is the cost of tuition a barrier to getting a college degree in the United States? Yes, but more so for students at two-year colleges than for students at four-year colleges.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0128"><p>In response to decreased state funding, many public colleges and universities have been experimenting with changes to their tuition schedule in order to increase revenue. A 2012 study found that in-state college freshmen were significantly more responsive to the cost of tuition than freshmen from out-of-state. In-state freshmen were found to have a measured elasticity of demand of 1.8; the elasticity of demand for out-of state freshmen was statistically insignificant (that is, virtually zero). Perhaps out-of-state applicants are less price sensitive because they have higher incomes.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch5-p0129"><p>Not surprisingly, many public colleges and universities have found that raising the tuition for enrollments of out-of-state students has boosted revenues.</p></div>
