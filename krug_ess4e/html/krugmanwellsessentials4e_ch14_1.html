<div data-block_type="co-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p13"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">E</span>VERY AUGUST MANY OF THE world’s most powerful financial officials and many influential economists gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Financial journalists come too, hoping to get clues about the future direction of policy. It’s always an interesting scene—but in August 2014 it was even more interesting than usual.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p14"><p>What was different about that year’s conclave? One answer was that the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, which makes U.S. monetary policy, had a new chair—and Janet Yellen had already made history as the first woman to hold the position.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p15"><p>Beyond the historic first, however, there was a widespread sense that August that U.S. monetary policy might be approaching a critical moment. For almost six years the Fed’s goal had been simple, if hard to accomplish: boost the U.S. economy out of a sustained job drought that had kept unemployment high. By the summer of 2014, however, the unemployment rate had fallen much of the way back toward historically normal levels. At some point, almost everyone agreed, it would be time for the Fed to take its foot off the gas and hit the brakes instead, raising interest rates that had been close to zero for years. But when?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p16"><p>It was a fraught question. Some Fed officials—so-called hawks, always ready to pounce on any sign of inflation—warned that if the Fed waited too long to raise rates, inflation would shoot up to unacceptable levels. Others—so-called doves—warned that the economy was still fragile, and that raising rates too soon would risk condemning the economy to a further stretch of high unemployment. Ms. Yellen was, in general, part of the dovish camp. But even she warned that controlling inflation must eventually take priority over reducing unemployment. At that point the Fed would have to raise rates.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p17"><p>Only time would tell who was right about the timing. As it turns out, it wasn’t until December 2015 that the Fed raised short-term interest rates—for the first time in nearly a decade.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p18"><p>But the dispute in 2014 highlighted the key concerns of macroeconomic policy. Unemployment and inflation are the two great evils of macroeconomics. So the two principal goals of macroeconomic policy are low unemployment and price stability, usually defined as a low but positive rate of inflation. Unfortunately, these goals sometimes seem to be in conflict with each other: economists often warn that policies intended to reduce unemployment run the risk of increasing inflation; conversely, policies intended to bring down inflation can raise unemployment.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="co-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p19"><p>The nature of the trade-off between low unemployment and low inflation and the policy dilemma it creates is a topic for later chapters. This chapter provides an overview of the basic facts about unemployment and inflation: how they’re measured, how they affect consumers and firms, and how they change over time.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p20"><p>The U.S. unemployment rate in February 2016 was 4.9%. That was a substantial improvement from the situation a few years earlier. In late 2009, after the Great Recession, unemployment peaked at 10%. But unemployment was still well above pre-recession levels; it was only 4.7% in November 2007.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p21"><p><span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-fig-2">Figure 14-1</span> shows the U.S. unemployment rate from 1948 to early 2016; as you can see, unemployment soared during the Great Recession of 2007–2009 and fell slowly in the years that followed. To understand what the elevated unemployment rate means, why it is such a big factor in people’s lives, and why policy makers pay so much attention to employment and unemployment, we need to look at how they are both defined and measured.</p></div>

Just because a person isn’t working doesn’t mean that we consider that person unemployed.

Most of them were probably happy that they were no longer working, so we wouldn’t consider someone who has settled into a comfortable, well-earned retirement to be unemployed. There were also 14 million disabled U.S. workers receiving benefits because they were unable to work. Again, although they weren’t working, we wouldn’t normally consider them to be unemployed.</p></div>

More specifically, an individual is considered unemployed if he or she doesn’t currently have a job and has been actively seeking a job during the past four weeks.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p32"><p>To estimate the numbers that go into calculating the unemployment rate, the U.S. Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey called the Current Population Survey, which involves interviewing a random sample of 60,000 American families. People are asked whether they are currently employed. If they are not employed, they are asked whether they have been looking for a job during the past four weeks. The results are then scaled up, using estimates of the total population, to estimate the total number of employed and unemployed Americans.</p></div>

<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-sec2-3">The Significance of the Unemployment Rate
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p33"><p>In general, the unemployment rate is a good indicator of how easy or difficult it is to find a job given the current state of the economy. When the unemployment rate is low, nearly everyone who wants a job can find one. In 2000, when the unemployment rate averaged just 4%, jobs were so abundant that employers spoke of a “mirror test” for getting a job: if you were breathing (therefore your breath would fog a mirror), you could find work. By contrast, in 2010, with the unemployment rate above 9% all year, it was very hard to find work. In fact, there were almost five times as many Americans seeking work as there were job openings.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p34"><p>Although the unemployment rate is a good indicator of current labor market conditions, it’s not a literal measure of the percentage of people who want a job but can’t find one. That’s because in some ways the unemployment rate exaggerates the difficulty people have in finding jobs. But in other ways, the opposite is true—a low unemployment rate can conceal deep frustration over the lack of job opportunities.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p35"><p><span data-block_type="h3-ri"><strong>How the Unemployment Rate Can Overstate the True Level of Unemployment</strong></span> If you are searching for work, it’s normal to take at least a few weeks to find a suitable job. Yet a worker who is quite confident of finding a job, but has not yet accepted a position, is counted as unemployed. As a consequence, the unemployment rate never falls to zero, even in boom times when jobs are plentiful. Even in the buoyant labor market of 2000, when it was easy to find work, the unemployment rate was still 4%. Later in this chapter, we’ll examine the reasons that measured unemployment persists even when jobs are abundant.</p></div>

In particular, an individual who has given up looking for a job for the time being because there are no jobs available—say, a laid-off steelworker in a deeply depressed steel town—isn’t counted as unemployed because he or she has not been searching for a job during the previous four weeks. Individuals who want to work but have told government researchers that they aren’t currently searching because they see little prospect of finding a job given the state of the job market are called <strong>discouraged workers.</strong> Because it does not count discouraged workers, the measured unemployment rate may understate the percentage of people who want to work but are unable to find jobs.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p40"><p>Discouraged workers are part of a larger group—<strong>marginally attached workers.</strong> These are people who say they would like to have a job and have looked for work in the recent past but are not currently looking for work. They, too, are not included when calculating the unemployment rate. Finally, another category of workers who are frustrated in their ability to find work but aren’t counted as unemployed are the <strong>underemployed:</strong> workers who would like to find full-time jobs but are currently working part time “for economic reasons”—that is, they can’t find a full-time job. Again, they aren’t counted in the unemployment rate.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-p41"><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is the federal agency that calculates the official unemployment rate. It also calculates broader “measures of labor underutilization” that include the three categories of frustrated workers. <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-fig-5">Figure 14-2</span> shows what happens to the measured unemployment rate once discouraged workers, other marginally attached workers, and the underemployed are counted. The broadest measure of unemployment and underemployment, known as U-6, is the sum of these three measures plus the unemployed. It is substantially higher than the rate usually quoted by the news media. But U-6 and the unemployment rate move very much in parallel, so changes in the unemployment rate remain a good guide to what’s happening in the overall labor market, including frustrated workers.</p></div>

As you can see, the unemployment rate for African-American workers is consistently much higher than the national average; the unemployment rate for White teenagers (ages 16–19) is normally even higher; and the unemployment rate for African-American teenagers is higher still. (Bear in mind that a teenager isn’t considered unemployed, even if he or she isn’t working, unless that teenager is looking for work but can’t find it.) So even at times when the overall unemployment rate is relatively low, jobs are hard to find for some groups.</p></div>

The long economic expansion of the 1990s eventually brought the unemployment rate to 4.0%, and the expansion of the mid-2000s brought the rate down to 4.7%. However, it’s important to recognize that <em>economic expansions aren’t always periods of falling unemployment.</em> Look at the periods immediately following the recessions of 1990–1991 and 2001 in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch14-fig-7">Figure 14-4</span>. In each case the unemployment rate continued to rise for more than a year after the recession was officially over. The explanation in both cases is that although the economy was growing, it was not growing fast enough to reduce the unemployment rate.</p></div>

The horizontal axis measures the annual rate of growth in real GDP—the percent by which each year’s real GDP changed compared to the previous year’s real GDP. (Notice that there were ten years in which growth was negative—that is, real GDP shrank.) The vertical axis measures the <em>change</em> in the unemployment rate over the previous year in percentage points—last year’s unemployment rate minus this year’s unemployment rate. Each dot represents the observed growth rate of real GDP and change in the unemployment rate for a given year. For example, in 2000 the average unemployment rate fell to 4.0% from 4.2% in 1999; this is shown as a value of <strong>−</strong>0.2 along the vertical axis for the year 2000.
