<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p98"><p>As we’ve suggested, once Cecil Rhodes consolidated the competing diamond producers of South Africa into a single company, the industry’s behavior changed: the quantity supplied fell and the market price rose. In this section, we will learn how a monopolist increases its profit by reducing output. And we will see the crucial role that market demand plays in leading a monopolist to behave differently from a perfectly competitive industry. (Remember that profit here is economic profit, not accounting profit.)</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p99"><p>In <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch7_1.html">Chapter 7</span> we derived the firm’s optimal output rule: a profit-maximizing firm produces the quantity of output at which the marginal cost of producing the last unit of output equals marginal revenue—the change in total revenue generated by that last unit of output. That is, <em>MR</em> = <em>MC</em> at the profit-maximizing quantity of output.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p100"><p>Although the optimal output rule holds for all firms, we will see shortly that its application leads to different profit-maximizing output levels for a monopolist compared to a firm in a perfectly competitive industry—that is, a price-taking firm. The source of that difference lies in the comparison of the demand curve faced by a monopolist to the demand curve faced by an individual perfectly competitive firm.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p101"><p>In addition to the optimal output rule, we also learned that even though the market demand curve always slopes downward, each of the firms that make up a perfectly competitive industry faces a <em>perfectly elastic</em> demand curve that is horizontal at the market price, like <em>D<sub>C</sub></em> in panel (a) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_04.html">Figure 8-4</span>. Any attempt by an individual firm in a perfectly competitive industry to charge more than the going market price will cause it to lose all its sales. It can, however, sell as much as it likes at the market price.</p></div>

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that all diamonds are exactly alike. And to make the arithmetic easy, we suppose that the number of diamonds sold is far smaller than is actually the case. For instance, at a price of $500 per diamond, we assume that only 10 diamonds are sold. The demand curve implied by this schedule is shown in panel (a) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_05.html">Figure 8-5</span>.</p></div>

<span data-type="number">Figure 8.5: </span><span data-type="caption">Panel (a) shows the monopolist’s demand and marginal revenue curves for diamonds from <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/table_8_1.html">Table 8-1</span>. The marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve. To see why, consider point <em>A</em> on the demand curve, where 9 diamonds are sold at $550 each, generating total revenue of $4,950. To sell a 10th diamond, the price on all 10 diamonds must be cut to $500, as shown by point <em>B</em>. As a result, total revenue increases by the green area (the quantity effect: + $500) but decreases by the yellow area (the price effect: −$450). So the marginal revenue from the 10th diamond is $50 (the difference between the green and yellow areas), which is much lower than its price, $500. Panel (b) shows the monopolist’s total revenue curve for diamonds. As output goes from 0 to 10 diamonds, total revenue increases. It reaches its maximum at 10 diamonds—the level at which marginal revenue is equal to 0—and declines thereafter. The quantity effect dominates the price effect when total revenue is rising; the price effect dominates the quantity effect when total revenue is falling.</span>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p106"><p>The third column of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/table_8_1.html">Table 8-1</span> shows De Beers’s total revenue from selling each quantity of diamonds—the price per diamond multiplied by the number of diamonds sold. The last column calculates marginal revenue, the change in total revenue from producing and selling another diamond.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p107"><p>Clearly, after the 1st diamond, the marginal revenue a monopolist receives from selling one more unit is less than the price at which that unit is sold. For example, if De Beers sells 10 diamonds, the price at which the 10th diamond is sold is $500. But the marginal revenue—the change in total revenue in going from 9 to 10 diamonds—is only $50.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p108"><p>Why is the marginal revenue from that 10th diamond less than the price? It is less than the price because an increase in production by a monopolist has two opposing effects on revenue:</p></div>
<ol data-block_type="numbered" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-list-8">
<li><div data-block_type="nl-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p109"><p><em>A quantity effect.</em> One more unit is sold, increasing total revenue by the price at which the unit is sold.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="nl-last" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p110"><p><em>A price effect.</em> In order to sell the last unit, the monopolist must cut the market price on <em>all</em> units sold. This decreases total revenue.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p111"><p>The quantity effect and the price effect when the monopolist goes from selling 9 diamonds to 10 diamonds are illustrated by the two shaded areas in panel (a) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_05.html">Figure 8-5</span>. Increasing diamond sales from 9 to 10 means moving down the demand curve from <em>A</em> to <em>B,</em> reducing the price per diamond from $550 to $500. The green-shaded area represents the quantity effect: De Beers sells the 10th diamond at a price of $500. This is offset, however, by the price effect, represented by the yellow-shaded area. In order to sell that 10th diamond, De Beers must reduce the price on all its diamonds from $550 to $500. So it loses 9 × $50 = $450 in revenue, the yellow-shaded area. As point <em>C</em> indicates, the total effect on revenue of selling one more diamond—the marginal revenue—derived from an increase in diamond sales from 9 to 10 is only $50.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p112"><p>Point <em>C</em> lies on the monopolist’s marginal revenue curve, labeled <em>MR</em> in panel (a) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_05.html">Figure 8-5</span> and taken from the last column of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/table_8_1.html">Table 8-1</span>. The crucial point about the monopolist’s marginal revenue curve is that it is always <em>below</em> the demand curve. That’s because of the price effect: a monopolist’s marginal revenue from selling an additional unit is always less than the price the monopolist receives for the previous unit. It is the price effect that creates the wedge between the monopolist’s marginal revenue curve and the demand curve: in order to sell an additional diamond, De Beers must cut the market price on all units sold.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_242"><p>242</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p113"><p>In fact, this wedge exists for any firm that possesses market power, such as an oligopolist as well as a monopolist. Having market power means that the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve. As a result, there will always be a price effect from an increase in its output. So for a firm with market power, the marginal revenue curve always lies below its demand curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p114"><p>Take a moment to compare the monopolist’s marginal revenue curve with the marginal revenue curve for a perfectly competitive firm, one without market power. For such a firm there is no price effect from an increase in output: its marginal revenue curve is simply its horizontal demand curve. So for a perfectly competitive firm, market price and marginal revenue are always equal.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p115"><p>To emphasize how the quantity and price effects offset each other for a firm with market power, De Beers’s total revenue curve is shown in panel (b) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_05.html">Figure 8-5</span>. Notice that it is hill-shaped: as output rises from 0 to 10 diamonds, total revenue increases. This reflects the fact that at <em>low levels of output, the quantity effect is stronger than the price effect:</em> as the monopolist sells more, it has to lower the price on only very few units, so the price effect is small. As output rises beyond 10 diamonds, total revenue actually falls. This reflects the fact that <em>at high levels of output, the price effect is stronger than the quantity effect:</em> as the monopolist sells more, it now has to lower the price on many units of output, making the price effect very large.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p116"><p>Correspondingly, the marginal revenue curve lies below zero at output levels above 10 diamonds. For example, an increase in diamond production from 11 to 12 yields only $400 for the 12th diamond, simultaneously reducing the revenue from diamonds 1 through 11 by $550. As a result, the marginal revenue of the 12th diamond is −$150.</p></div>

Let’s assume that there is no fixed cost of production; we’ll also assume that the marginal cost of producing an additional diamond is constant at $200, no matter how many diamonds De Beers produces. Then marginal cost will always equal average total cost, and the marginal cost curve (and the average total cost curve) is a horizontal line at $200, as shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_06.html">Figure 8-6</span>.</p></div>

Marginal cost per diamond is constant at $200, so the marginal cost curve is horizontal at $200. According to the optimal output rule, the profit-maximizing quantity of output for the monopolist is at <em>MR</em> = <em>MC</em>, shown by point <em>A</em>, where the marginal cost and marginal revenue curves cross at an output of 8 diamonds. The price De Beers can charge per diamond is found by going to the point on the demand curve directly above point <em>A</em>, which is point <em>B</em> here—a price of $600 per diamond. It makes a profit of $400 × 8 = $3,200. A perfectly competitive industry produces the output level at which <em>P</em> = <em>MC</em>, given by point <em>C</em>, where the demand curve and marginal cost curves cross.

<div data-block_type="bx1-t" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p127"><p><strong>IS THERE A MONOPOLY SUPPLY CURVE?</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p128"><p>Given how a monopolist applies its optimal output rule, you might be tempted to ask what this implies for the supply curve of a monopolist. But this is a meaningless question: <em>monopolists don’t have supply curves</em>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p129"><p>Remember that a supply curve shows the quantity that producers are willing to supply for any given market price. A monopolist, however, does not take the price as given; it chooses a profitmaximizing quantity, taking into account its own ability to influence the price.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p130"><p>If the diamond industry consists of many perfectly competitive firms, each of those producers takes the market price as given. That is, each producer acts as if its marginal revenue is equal to the market price. So each firm within the industry uses the price-taking firm’s optimal output rule:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p131"><p><strong>(8-2)</strong> <em>P</em> = <em>MC</em> at the perfectly competitive firm’s profit-maximizing quantity of output</p></div>

So the profit-maximizing output of an industry under perfect competition, <em>Q<sub>C</sub>,</em> is 16 diamonds.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p133"><p>But does the perfectly competitive industry earn any profits at <em>C</em>? No: the price of $200 is equal to the average total cost per diamond. So there are no economic profits for this industry when it produces at the perfectly competitive output level.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p134"><p>We’ve already seen that once the industry is consolidated into a monopoly, the result is very different. The monopolist’s calculation of marginal revenue takes the price effect into account, so that marginal revenue is less than the price. That is,</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p135"><p><strong>(8-3)</strong> <em>P</em> &gt; <em>MR</em> = <em>MC</em> at the monopolist’s profit-maximizing quantity of output</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p136"><p>As we’ve already seen, the monopolist produces less than the competitive industry—8 diamonds rather than 16. The price under monopoly is $600, compared with only $200 under perfect competition. The monopolist earns a positive profit, but the competitive industry does not.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p152"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">H</span>istorically, electric utilities were recognized as natural monopolies. A utility serviced a defined geographical area, owning the plants that generated electricity as well as the transmission lines that delivered it to retail customers. The rates charged customers were regulated by the government, set at a level to cover the utility’s cost of operation plus a modest return on capital to its shareholders.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p153"><p>Beginning in the late 1990s, however, there was a move toward deregulation, based on the belief that competition would result in lower retail electricity prices. Competition was introduced at two junctures in the channel from power generation to retail customers: (1) distributors would compete to sell electricity to retail customers, and (2) power generators would compete to supply power to the distributors.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p154"><p>That was the theory, at least. By 2014, only 16 states had instituted some form of electricity deregulation, while 7 had started but then suspended deregulation, leaving 27 states to continue with a regulated monopoly electricity provider. Why did so few states actually follow through on electricity deregulation?</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p155"><p>One major obstacle to lowering electricity prices through deregulation is the lack of choice in power generators, the bulk of which still entail large up-front fixed costs. As a result, in many markets there is only one power generator. Although consumers appear to have a choice in their electricity distributor, the choice is illusory, as everyone must get their electricity from the same source in the end.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p156"><p>In fact, deregulation can make consumers worse off when there is only one power generator. That’s because deregulation allows the power generator to engage in market manipulation—intentionally reducing the amount of power supplied to distributors in order to drive up prices. The most shocking case occurred during the California energy crisis of 2000–2001 that brought blackouts and billions of dollars in electricity surcharges to homes and businesses. On audiotapes later acquired by regulators, workers could be heard discussing plans to shut down power plants during times of peak energy demand, joking about how they were “stealing” more than $1 million a day from California.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p157"><p>Another problem is that without prices set by regulators, producers aren’t guaranteed a profitable rate of return on new power plants. As a result, in states with deregulation, capacity has failed to keep up with growing demand. For example, Texas, a deregulated state, has experienced massive blackouts due to insufficient capacity, and in New Jersey and Maryland, regulators have intervened to compel producers to build more power plants.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p158"><p>Lastly, consumers in deregulated states have been subject to big spikes in their electricity bills, often paying much more than consumers in regulated states. So, angry customers and exasperated regulators have prompted many states to shift into reverse, with Illinois, Montana, and Virginia moving to regulate their industries. California and Montana have gone so far as to mandate that their electricity distributors reacquire power plants that were sold off during deregulation. In addition, regulators have been on the prowl, fining utilities in Texas, New York, and Illinois for market manipulation.</p></div>
