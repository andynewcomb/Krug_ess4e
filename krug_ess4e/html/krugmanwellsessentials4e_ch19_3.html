<div data-block_type="ext-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p70"><p><em>The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 2¼ percent.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="ext-last" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p71"><p><em>Recent information indicates that the outlook for economic activity has weakened further. Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p72"><p>So read the beginning of a press release from the Federal Reserve issued on March 18, 2008. (A basis point is equal to 0.01 percentage point. So the statement implies that the Fed lowered the target from 3% to 2.25%.) We learned about the federal funds rate in the previous chapter: it’s the rate at which banks lend reserves to each other to meet the required reserve ratio. As the statement implies, at each of its eight-times-a-year meetings, a group called the Federal Open Market Committee sets a target value for the federal funds rate. It’s then up to Fed officials to achieve that target. This is done by the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which buys and sells short-term U.S. government debt, known as Treasury bills, to achieve that target.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p73"><p>As we’ve already seen, other short-term interest rates, such as the rates on CDs, move with the federal funds rate. So when the Fed reduced its target for the federal funds rate from 3% to 2.25% in March 2008, many other short-term interest rates also fell by about three-quarters of a percentage point.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p74"><p>How does the Fed go about achieving a <em>target federal funds rate?</em> And more to the point, how is the Fed able to affect interest rates at all?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p78"><p>As we’ve learned, the Federal Reserve can increase or decrease the money supply: it usually does this through <em>open-market operations,</em> buying or selling Treasury bills, but it can also lend via the <em>discount window</em> or change <em>reserve requirements.</em> Let’s assume for simplicity that the Fed, using one or more of these methods, simply chooses the level of the money supply that it believes will achieve its interest rate target. Then the money supply curve is a vertical line, <em>MS</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch19/KrugESS4e_fig_19_03.html">Figure 19-3</span>, with a horizontal intercept corresponding to the money supply chosen by the Fed, <img id="" src="asset/ch19/KrugESS4e_ineqn_548_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image">. The money market equilibrium is at <em>E</em>, where <em>MS</em> and <em>MD</em> cross.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p79"><p>To understand why <em>r<sub>E</sub></em> is the equilibrium interest rate, consider what happens if the money market is at a point like <em>L</em>, where the interest rate, <em>r<sub>L</sub>,</em> is below <em>r<sub>E</sub>.</em> At <em>r<sub>L</sub></em> the public wants to hold the quantity of money <em>M<sub>L</sub>,</em> an amount larger than the actual money supply, <img id="" src="asset/ch19/KrugESS4e_ineqn_548_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"><em>.</em> This means that at point <em>L</em>, the public wants to shift some of its wealth out of interest-bearing assets such as CDs into money.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p80"><p>This result has two implications. One is that the quantity of money demanded is <em>more</em> than the quantity of money supplied. The other is that the quantity of interest-bearing money assets demanded is less than the quantity supplied. So those trying to sell nonmoney assets will find that they have to offer a higher interest rate to attract buyers. As a result, the interest rate will be driven up from <em>r<sub>L</sub></em>until the public wants to hold the quantity of money that is actually available, <img id="" src="asset/ch19/KrugESS4e_ineqn_548_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image">. That is, the interest rate will rise until it is equal to <em>r<sub>E</sub>.</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p81"><p>Now consider what happens if the money market is at a point such as <em>H</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch19/KrugESS4e_fig_19_03.html">Figure 19-3</span>, where the interest rate <em>r<sub>H</sub></em>is above <em>r<sub>E</sub>.</em> In that case the quantity of money demanded, <em>M<sub>H</sub>,</em> is less than the quantity of money supplied, <img id="" src="asset/ch19/KrugESS4e_ineqn_548_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"><em>.</em> Correspondingly, the quantity of interest-bearing nonmoney assets demanded is greater than the quantity supplied. Those trying to sell interest-bearing nonmoney assets will find that they can offer a lower interest rate and still find willing buyers. This leads to a fall in the interest rate from <em>r<sub>H</sub>.</em> It falls until the public wants to hold the quantity of money that is actually available, <img id="" src="asset/ch19/KrugESS4e_ineqn_548_01.jpg" data-figure-id="" data-layout-width="" data-mmtype="" alt="image"><em>.</em> Again, the interest rate will end up at <em>r<sub>E</sub>.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p83"><p>Over the years, the Federal Reserve has changed the way in which monetary policy is implemented. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, it set a target level for the money supply and altered the monetary base to achieve that target. Under this operating procedure, the federal funds rate fluctuated freely. Today the Fed uses the reverse procedure, setting a target for the federal funds rate and allowing the money supply to fluctuate as it pursues that target.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p84"><p>A common mistake is to imagine that these changes in the way the Fed operates alter the way the money market works. That is, people sometimes say that the interest rate no longer reflects the supply and demand for money because the Fed sets the interest rate.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p85"><p>In fact, the money market works the same way as always: the interest rate is determined by the supply and demand for money. The only difference is that now the Fed adjusts the supply of money to achieve its target interest rate. It’s important not to confuse a change in the Fed’s operating procedure with a change in the way the economy works.</p></div>

The other tools of monetary policy, lending through the discount window and changes in reserve requirements, aren’t used on a regular basis (although the Fed used discount window lending in its efforts to address the 2008 financial crisis).</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p92"><p>Earlier we mentioned that <em>long-term interest rates—</em>rates on bonds or loans that mature in several years—don’t necessarily move with short-term interest rates. How is that possible, and what does it say about monetary policy?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p93"><p>Consider the case of Millie, who has already decided to place $10,000 in U.S. government bonds for the next two years. However, she hasn’t decided whether to put the money in one-year bonds, at a 4% rate of interest, or two-year bonds, at a 5% rate of interest. If she buys the one-year bond, then in one year, Millie will receive the $10,000 she paid for the bond (the <em>principal</em>) plus interest earned. If she buys the two-year bond instead, Millie will have to wait until the end of the second year to receive her principal and her interest.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p94"><p>You might think that the two-year bonds are a clearly better deal—but they may not be. Suppose that Millie expects the rate of interest on one-year bonds to rise sharply next year. If she puts her funds in one-year bonds this year, she will be able to reinvest the money at a much higher rate next year. And this could give her a two-year rate of return that is higher than if she put her funds into the two-year bonds today. For example, if the rate of interest on one-year bonds rises from 4% this year to 8% next year, putting her funds in a one-year bond today and in another one-year bond a year from now will give her an annual rate of return over the next two years of about 6%, better than the 5% rate on two-year bonds.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p95"><p>The same considerations apply to all investors deciding between short-term and long-term bonds. If they expect short-term interest rates to rise, investors may buy short-term bonds even if long-term bonds bought today offer a higher interest rate today. If they expect short-term interest rates to fall, investors may buy long-term bonds even if short-term bonds bought today offer a higher interest rate today.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p96"><p>As the example suggests, long-term interest rates largely reflect the average expectation in the market about what’s going to happen to short-term rates in the future. When long-term rates are higher than short-term rates, as they were in 2014, the market is signaling that it expects short-term rates to rise in the future.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p97"><p>This is not, however, the whole story: risk is also a factor. Return to the example of Millie, deciding whether to buy one-year or two-year bonds. Suppose that there is some chance she will need to cash in her investment after just one year—say, to meet an emergency medical bill. If she buys two-year bonds, she would have to sell those bonds to meet the unexpected expense. But what price will she get for those bonds? It depends on what has happened to interest rates in the rest of the economy. Bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions: if interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p98"><p>This means that Millie will face extra risk if she buys two-year rather than one-year bonds, because if a year from now bond prices fall and she must sell her bonds in order to raise cash, she will lose money on the bonds. Owing to this risk factor, long-term interest rates are, on average, higher than short-term rates in order to compensate long-term bond purchasers for the higher risk they face (although this relationship is reversed when short-term rates are unusually high).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch19-p99"><p>As we will see later in this chapter, the fact that long-term rates don’t necessarily move with short-term rates is sometimes an important consideration for monetary policy.</p></div>

This particular action was part of a larger story: a dramatic reversal of Fed policy that began in September 2007.</p></div>

As you can see, the Fed raised its target rate in a series of steps from late 2004 until the middle of 2006. It did this to head off the possibility of an overheating economy and rising inflation. But the Fed dramatically reversed course beginning in September 2007, as falling housing prices triggered a growing financial crisis and ultimately a severe recession. And in December 2008, the Fed decided to allow the federal funds rate to move inside a target band between 0% and 0.25%.</p></div>

There were a number of days, especially in 2008, when the effective federal funds rate was significantly above or below the target rate. But these episodes didn’t last long, and overall the Fed got what it wanted, at least as far as short-term interest rates were concerned.</p></div>
