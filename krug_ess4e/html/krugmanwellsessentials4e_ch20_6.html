<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p265"><p>We’ve just seen how differences in the supply of loanable funds from savings and the demand for loanable funds for investment spending lead to international capital flows. We’ve also learned that a country’s balance of payments on current account plus its balance of payments on financial account add to zero: a country that receives net capital inflows must run a matching current account deficit, and a country that generates net capital outflows must run a matching current account surplus.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p266"><p>The behavior of the financial account—reflecting inflows or outflows of capital—is best described by equilibrium in the international loanable funds market. At the same time, the balance of payments on goods and services, the main component of the current account, is determined by decisions in the international markets for goods and services. So given that the financial account reflects the movement of capital and the current account reflects the movement of goods and services, what ensures that the balance of payments really does balance? That is, what ensures that the two accounts actually offset each other?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p267"><p>Not surprisingly, a price is what makes these two accounts balance. Specifically, that price is the <em>exchange rate,</em> which is determined in the <em>foreign exchange market.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p273"><p>There are two ways to write any given exchange rate. In this case, there were €0.8072 to US$1 and US$1.2388 to €1. Which is the correct way to write it? The answer is that there is no fixed rule. In most countries, people tend to express the exchange rate as the price of a dollar in domestic currency. However, this rule isn’t universal, and the U.S. dollar–euro rate is commonly quoted both ways. The important thing is to be sure you know which one you are using!

<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p278"><p>What does it mean when someone says “the U.S. exchange rate is up”?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p279"><p>It isn’t clear. Sometimes the exchange rate is measured as the price of a dollar in terms of foreign currency, sometimes as the price of foreign currency in terms of dollars. So the statement could mean either that the dollar appreciated or that it depreciated!</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p280"><p>And be careful when using published statistics. Most countries other than the United States state their exchange rates in terms of the price of a dollar in their domestic currency—for example, Mexican officials will say that the exchange rate is 10, meaning 10 pesos per dollar. But Britain, for historical reasons, usually states its exchange rate the other way. On November 21, 2014, US$1 was worth £0.6362, and £1 was worth US$1.5718. More often than not, this number is reported as an exchange rate of 1.5718.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p281"><p>Americans generally follow other countries’ lead: we usually say that the exchange rate against Mexico is 10 pesos per dollar but that the exchange rate against Britain is 1.57 dollars per pound. But this rule isn’t reliable; exchange rates against the euro are often stated both ways.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p282"><p>So always check before using exchange rate data: which way is the exchange rate being measured?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p283"><p>Movements in exchange rates, other things equal, affect the relative prices of goods, services, and assets in different countries. Suppose, for example, that the price of an American hotel room is US$100 and the price of a French hotel room is €100. If the exchange rate is €1 = US$1, these hotel rooms have the same price. If the exchange rate is €1.25 = US$1, the French hotel room is 20% cheaper than the American hotel room. If the exchange rate is €0.80 = US$1, the French hotel room is 25% more expensive than the American hotel room.</p></div>

That is, Europeans demand U.S. dollars from the foreign exchange market and, correspondingly, supply euros to that market. Americans wanting to buy European goods, services, and assets come to the foreign exchange market to exchange U.S. dollars for euros. That is, Americans supply U.S. dollars to the foreign exchange market and, correspondingly, demand euros from that market.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p288"><p>To understand why the demand curve for U.S. dollars slopes downward, recall that the exchange rate, other things equal, determines the prices of American goods, services, and assets relative to those of European goods, services, and assets.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p290"><p>If the U.S. dollar falls against the euro (the dollar depreciates), American products will become relatively cheaper for Europeans.

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p301"><p>Let’s briefly run this process in reverse. Suppose there is a reduction in capital flows from Europe to the United States—again due to a change in the preferences of European investors. The demand for U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market falls, and the dollar depreciates: the number of euros per U.S. dollar at the equilibrium exchange rate falls. This leads Americans to buy fewer European products and Europeans to buy more American products. Ultimately, this generates an increase in the U.S. balance of payments on current account. So a fall in capital flows into the United States leads to a weaker dollar, which in turn generates an increase in U.S. net exports.</p></div>

Did Mexican products also become much cheaper relative to U.S. products over that 20-year period? Did the price of Mexican products expressed in terms of U.S. dollars also fall by 75%? The answer is no, because Mexico had much higher inflation than the United States over that period.

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p313"><p>A useful tool for analyzing exchange rates, closely connected to the concept of the real exchange rate, is known as <em>purchasing power parity.</em> The <strong>purchasing power parity</strong> between two countries’ currencies is the nominal exchange rate at which a given basket of goods and services would cost the same amount in each country. Suppose, for example, that a basket of goods and services that costs $100 in the United States costs 1,000 pesos in Mexico. Then the purchasing power parity is 10 pesos per U.S. dollar: at that exchange rate, 1,000 pesos = $100, so the market basket costs the same amount in both countries.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p314"><p>Calculations of purchasing power parities are usually made by estimating the cost of buying broad market baskets containing many goods and services—everything from automobiles and groceries to housing and telephone calls. But as the following For Inquiring Minds explains, once a year the magazine <em>The Economist</em> publishes a list of purchasing power parities based on the cost of buying a market basket that contains only one item—a McDonald’s Big Mac.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p315"><p>Nominal exchange rates almost always differ from purchasing power parities. Some of these differences are systematic: in general, aggregate price levels are lower in poor countries than in rich countries because services tend to be cheaper in poor countries. But even among countries at roughly the same level of economic development, nominal exchange rates vary quite a lot from purchasing power parity. <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch20/KrugESS4e_fig_20_17.html">Figure 20-17</span> shows the nominal exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, measured as the number of Canadian dollars per U.S. dollar, from 1990 to 2013, together with an estimate of the purchasing power parity exchange rate between the United States and Canada over the same period.</p></div>

Analysts at Italian carmaker Fiat determined that it needs to build a North American factory to profit from the upcoming relaunch of its Alfa Romeo model. Tennessee recently closed a deal with Volkswagen to build a $1 billion factory by offering $577 million in incentives.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p326"><p>Why were European automakers flocking to America? To some extent because they were being offered special incentives, as the case of Volkswagen in Tennessee illustrates. But the big factor was the exchange rate. In the early 2000s one euro was, on average, worth less than a dollar; by the summer of 2008 the exchange rate was around €1 = $1.50. This change in the exchange rate made it substantially cheaper for European car manufacturers to produce in the United States than at home—especially if the cars were intended for the U.S. market.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch20-p327"><p>Automobile manufacturing wasn’t the only U.S. industry benefiting from the weak dollar; across the board, U.S. exports surged after 2006 while import growth fell off. <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch20/KrugESS4e_fig_20_18.html">Figure 20-18</span> shows one measure of U.S. trade performance, real net exports of goods and services: exports minus imports, both measured in 2009 dollars. As you can see, this balance, after a long slide, turned sharply upward in 2006. There was a modest reversal in 2009–2010, as an economy recovering from the 2007–2009 recession pulled in more imports, but a major narrowing of the trade gap remained in place.</p></div>
