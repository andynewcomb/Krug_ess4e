<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p22"><p>There are three major economic rationales for the creation of the welfare state.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p23"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>1. Alleviating Income Inequality</strong></span> Suppose that the Taylor family, which has an income of only $15,000 a year, were to receive a government check for $1,500. This check might allow the Taylors to afford a better place to live, eat a more nutritious diet, or in other ways significantly improve their quality of life. Also suppose that the Fisher family, which has an income of $300,000 a year, were to face an extra tax of $1,500. This probably wouldn’t make much difference to their quality of life: at worst, they might have to give up a few minor luxuries.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p25"><p>This hypothetical exchange illustrates the first major rationale for the welfare state: <em>alleviating income inequality.</em> Because a marginal dollar is worth more to a poor person than a rich one, modest transfers from the rich to the poor will do the rich little harm but benefit the poor a lot. So, according to this argument, a government that takes from the rich to give to the poor, does more good than harm. Programs that are designed to aid the poor are known as <strong>poverty programs.</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p26"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>2. Alleviating Economic Insecurity</strong></span> The second major rationale for the welfare state is <em>alleviating economic insecurity.</em> Imagine ten families, each of which can expect an income next year of $50,000 if nothing goes wrong. But suppose the odds are that something <em>will</em> go wrong for one of the families, although nobody knows which one. For example, suppose each of the families has a one in ten chance of experiencing a sharp drop in income because one family member is laid off or incurs large medical bills. And assume that this event will produce severe hardship for the family—a family member will have to drop out of school or the family will lose its home.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="mn-gl-def" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p27"><p>A <strong>social insurance program</strong> is a government program designed to provide protection against unpredictable financial distress.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p28"><p>Now suppose there’s a government program that provides aid to families in distress, paying for that aid by taxing families that are having a good year. Arguably, this program will make all the families better off, because even families that don’t currently receive aid from the program might need it at some point in the future. Each family will therefore feel safer knowing that the government stands ready to help when disaster strikes. Programs designed to provide protection against unpredictable financial distress are known as <strong>social insurance programs.</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p29"><p>These two rationales for the welfare state, alleviating income inequality and alleviating economic insecurity, are closely related to a major principle of tax fairness, the <em>ability-to-pay principle</em>, according to which those with greater ability to pay a tax should pay more. The principle is usually interpreted to mean that people with low incomes, for whom an additional dollar makes a big difference to economic well-being, should pay a smaller fraction of their income in taxes than people with higher incomes, for whom an additional dollar makes much less difference. The same principle suggests that those with very low incomes should actually get money back from the tax system.</p></div>

</h3>

<div data-block_type="bx3-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p31"><p>In 1971 the philosopher John Rawls published <em>A Theory of Justice,</em> the most famous attempt to date to develop a theory of economic fairness. He asked readers to imagine deciding economic and social policies behind a “veil of ignorance” about their own identity. That is, suppose you knew you would be a human being but did not know whether you would be rich or poor, healthy or sick, and so on. Rawls argued that the policies that would emerge if people had to make decisions behind the veil of ignorance define what we mean by economic justice. It’s sort of a generalized version of the Golden Rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you if you were in their place.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p32"><p>Rawls also argued that people behind the veil of ignorance would choose policies that placed a high value on the well-being of the worst-off members of society: after all, each of us might be one of those unlucky individuals. As a result, Rawlsian theory is often used as an argument for a generous welfare state.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p33"><p>Three years after Rawls published his book, another philosopher, Robert Nozick, published <em>Anarchy, State, and Utopia,</em> which is often considered the libertarian response. Nozick argued that justice is a matter of rights, not results, and that the government has no right to force people with high incomes to support others with lower incomes. He argued for a minimal government that enforces the law and provides security—the “night watchman state”—and against the welfare state programs that account for so much government spending.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p34"><p>Philosophers, of course, don’t run the world. But real-world political debate often contains arguments that are clearly based upon either a Rawls-type or a Nozick-type position.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p35"><p>Even after adjusting for ability, children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to be underemployed or unemployed, engage in crime, and to suffer chronic health problems—all of which impose significant social costs. So, according to the evidence, programs that help to alleviate poverty and provide access to health care generate external benefits to society.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p36"><p>More broadly, as the For Inquiring Minds explains, some political philosophers argue that principles of social justice demand that society take care of the poor and unlucky. Others disagree, arguing that welfare state programs go beyond the proper role of government. To an important extent, the difference between those two philosophical positions defines what we mean in politics by “liberalism” and “conservatism.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p37"><p>But before we get carried away, it’s important to realize that things aren’t quite that cut and dried. Even conservatives who believe in limited government typically support some welfare state programs. And even economists who support the goals of the welfare state are concerned about the effects of large-scale aid to the poor and unlucky on their incentives to work and save. Like taxes, welfare state programs can create substantial deadweight losses, so their true economic costs can be considerably larger than the direct monetary cost.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p38"><p>We’ll turn to the costs and benefits of the welfare state later. First, however, let’s examine the problems the welfare state is supposed to address.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p39"><p>For at least the past 75 years, every U.S. president has promised to do his best to reduce poverty. In 1964 President Lyndon Johnson went so far as to declare a “war on poverty,” creating a number of new programs to aid the poor. Anti-poverty programs account for a significant part of the U.S. welfare state, although social insurance programs are an even larger part.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p41"><p>But what, exactly, do we mean by poverty? Any definition is somewhat arbitrary. Since 1965, however, the U.S. government has maintained an official definition of the <strong>poverty threshold,</strong> a minimum annual income that is considered adequate to purchase the necessities of life. Families whose incomes fall below the poverty threshold are considered poor.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p42"><p>The official poverty threshold depends on the size and composition of a family. In 2015 the poverty threshold for an adult living alone was $12,331; for a household consisting of two adults and two children, it was $24,036.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p43"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Trends in Poverty</strong></span> Contrary to popular misconceptions, although the official poverty threshold is adjusted each year to reflect changes in the cost of living, it has not been adjusted upward over time to reflect the long-term rise in the standard of living of the average American family. As a result, as the economy grows and becomes more prosperous, and as average incomes rise, you might expect the percentage of the population living below the poverty threshold to steadily decline.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p45"><p>However, this hasn’t happened. The orange line in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch11/KrugESS4e_fig_11_01.html">Figure 11-1</span> shows the official U.S. <strong>poverty rate—</strong>the percentage of the population living below the poverty threshold—from 1967 to 2014. As you can see, since 1967 the poverty rate—which fell steeply during the early 1960s—has fluctuated up and down, with no clear trend. In 2014, the poverty rate was higher than it had been 40 years earlier, even though America as a whole was far richer. In response to this surprising result, researchers have identified a number of limitations to the official poverty measure, of which the most important is that the definition of income doesn’t actually include many forms of government aid. For example, it excludes the monetary value of food stamps. So the U.S. Census Bureau now releases a Supplemental Poverty Measure that includes income from government aid, a measure that experts consider to be more accurate. The burgundy line in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch11/KrugESS4e_fig_11_01.html">Figure 11-1</span> shows how this measure has changed over time. While it shows more progress than the standard measure, the change is still surprisingly little considering that the real income of the average household has risen about 40% since 1970.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p46"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Who Are the Poor?</strong></span> Many Americans probably hold a stereotyped image of poverty: an African-American or Hispanic family with no husband present and the female head of the household unemployed at least part of the time. This picture isn’t completely off base: poverty is disproportionately high among African-Americans and Hispanics as well as among female-headed households. But a majority of the poor don’t fit the stereotype.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p47"><p>In 2014, 46.7 million Americans were in poverty—14.8% of the population, or slightly more than one in seven persons. And 23% of the poor were African-American, substantially exceeding their share of the overall population (only about 13% of the population is African-American). Hispanics were also more likely than the average American to be poor, with a poverty rate of 23.6%. But there was also widespread poverty among non-Hispanic Whites, who made up 42% of the poor.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_319"><p>319</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p48"><p>There is also a correlation between family makeup and poverty. Female-headed families with no husband present had a very high poverty rate: 30.6%. Married couples were much less likely to be poor, with a poverty rate of only 6.2%; still, about 39% of the poor were in married families with both spouses present.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p49"><p>What really stands out in the data, however, is the association between poverty and inadequate employment. Adults who work full time are very unlikely to be poor: only 3% of full-time workers were poor in 2014. Many industries, particularly in the retail and service sectors, now rely primarily on part-time workers. Part-time work typically lacks benefits such as health plans, paid vacation days, and retirement benefits, and it also usually pays a lower hourly wage than comparable full-time work. As a result, many of the poor are members of what analysts call the <em>working poor:</em> workers whose incomes fall at or below the poverty threshold.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p50"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>What Causes Poverty?</strong></span> Poverty is often blamed on lack of education, and educational attainment clearly has a strong positive effect on income level—those with more education earn, on average, higher incomes than those with less education. For example, in 1979 the average hourly wage of men with a college degree was 38% higher than that of men with only a high school diploma; by 2014, the “college premium” had increased to 85%.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p51"><p>Lack of proficiency in English is also a barrier to higher income. For example, Mexican-born male workers in the United States—two-thirds of whom have not graduated from high school and many of whom have poor English skills—earn less than half of what native-born men earn.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p52"><p>And it’s important not to overlook the role of racial and gender discrimination; although less pervasive today than 50 years ago, discrimination still erects formidable barriers to advancement for many Americans. Non-Whites earn less and are less likely to be employed than Whites with comparable levels of education. Studies find that African-American males suffer persistent discrimination by employers in favor of Whites, African-American women, and Hispanic immigrants. Women earn lower incomes than men with similar qualifications.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p53"><p>Another important source of poverty that should not be overlooked is bad luck. Many families find themselves impoverished when a wage-earner loses a job or a family member falls seriously ill.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p54"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Consequences of Poverty</strong></span> The consequences of poverty are often severe, particularly for children. In 2014, 21% of children in the United States lived in poverty. Poverty is often associated with lack of access to health care, which can lead to further health problems that erode the ability to attend school and work later in life. Affordable housing is also frequently a problem, leading poor families to move often, disrupting school and work schedules. Recent medical studies have shown that children raised in severe poverty tend to suffer from lifelong learning disabilities. As a result, American children growing up in or near poverty don’t have an equal chance at the starting line: they tend to be at a disadvantage throughout their lives. Even talented children who come from poor families are unlikely to finish college.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p55"><p>The United States is a rich country. In 2007, before the recession hit, the average U.S. household had an income (in 2014 prices) of $77,198, far exceeding the poverty threshold. Even after a devastating recession followed by a sluggish recovery, average household income in 2014 was $75,738. How is it possible, then, that so many Americans still live in poverty? The answer is that income is unequally distributed, with many households earning much less than the average and others earning much more.</p></div>

It’s very important to realize that these two numbers measure different things.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p61"><p>Economists often illustrate the difference by asking people first to imagine a room containing several dozen more or less ordinary wage-earners, then to think about what happens to the mean and median incomes of the people in the room if a Wall Street billionaire walks in. The mean income soars, because the billionaire’s income pulls up the average, but median income hardly rises at all.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p62"><p>This example helps explain why economists generally regard median income as a better guide to the economic status of typical American families than mean income: mean income is strongly affected by the incomes of a relatively small number of very-high-income Americans, who are not representative of the population as a whole; median income is not.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p63"><p>What we learn from <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch11/table_11_1.html">Table 11-1</span> is that income in the United States is quite unequally distributed. The average income of the poorest fifth of families is less than a quarter of the average income of families in the middle, and the richest fifth have an average income more than three times that of families in the middle. The incomes of the richest fifth of the population are, on average, about 15 times as high as those of the poorest fifth. In fact, the distribution of income in America has become more unequal since 1980, rising to a level that has made it a significant political issue. The upcoming Economics in Action discusses long-term trends in U.S. income inequality, which declined in the 1930s and 1940s, was stable for more than 30 years after World War II, but began rising again in the late 1970s.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p65"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>The Gini Coefficient</strong></span> It’s often convenient to have a single number that summarizes a country’s level of income inequality. The <strong>Gini coefficient,</strong> the most widely used measure of inequality, is based on how disparately income is distributed across the quintiles (as we see in the Global Comparison). A country with a perfectly equal distribution of income—that is, one in which the bottom 20% of the population received 20% of the income, the bottom 40% of the population received 40% of the income, and so on—would have a Gini coefficient of 0. At the other extreme, the highest possible value for the Gini coefficient is 1—the level it would attain if all a country’s income went to just one person.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p66"><p>One way to get a sense of what Gini coefficients mean in practice is to look at international comparisons. Aside from a few countries in Africa, the highest levels of income inequality are found in Latin America, especially Colombia; countries with a high degree of inequality have Gini coefficients close to 0.6. The most equal distributions of income are in Europe, especially in Scandinavia; countries with very equal income distributions, such as Sweden, have Gini coefficients around 0.33. Compared to other wealthy countries, as of 2012 the United States, with a Gini coefficient of 0.57, has unusually high inequality, though it isn’t as unequal as in Latin America.</p></div>

You’ll almost surely come away with the impression that Scandinavia has substantially less income inequality than America, that the rich aren’t as rich and the poor aren’t as poor. And the numbers confirm this impression: Gini coefficients, a number that summarizes a country’s level of income inequality, for Sweden and Denmark, and indeed for most of Western Europe, are substantially lower than in the United States. But why?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p69"><p>The answer, to a large extent, is the role of government, which, in the United States, plays a significant role in redistributing income away from those with the highest incomes to those who earn the least. But European nations have substantially bigger welfare states than we do, and do a lot more income redistribution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p70"><p>The figure shows two measures of the Gini coefficient for a number of rich countries. A country with a perfectly equal income distribution—one in which every household had the same income—would have a Gini coefficient of zero. At the other extreme, in which all of a country’s income goes to one household, a country would have a Gini coefficient of 1. For each country, the purple bar shows the actual Gini, a measure of the observed inequality in income before taxes and transfers are made. The orange bars show what each country’s Gini would be after taxes and transfers are made. It turns out that the inequality of market incomes in Denmark and Sweden is comparable to that in the United States—their much lower observed inequality is the result of their bigger welfare states.</p></div>

</ul>
<div data-block_type="bx4-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p74"><p>Still, the data strongly suggest that differences in inequality among rich countries largely reflect different policies rather than differences in the underlying economic situation.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx4-sc" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p75"><p><em>Data from:</em> Luxembourg Income Study.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p76"><p>How serious an issue is income inequality? In a direct sense, high income inequality means that some people don’t share in a nation’s overall prosperity. As we’ve seen, rising inequality explains how it’s possible that the U.S. poverty rate has failed to fall for the past 45 years even though the country as a whole has become considerably richer. Also, extreme inequality, as found in Latin America, is often associated with political instability because of tension between a wealthy minority and the rest of the population.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p77"><p>It’s important to realize, however, that the data shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch11/table_11_1.html">Table 11-1</span> overstate the true degree of inequality in America, for several reasons. One is that the data represent a snapshot for a single year, whereas the incomes of many individual families fluctuate over time. That is, many of those near the bottom in any given year are having an unusually bad year and many of those at the top are having an unusually good one. Over time, their incomes will revert to a more normal level. So a table showing average incomes within quintiles over a longer period, such as a decade, would not show as much inequality.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p78"><p>Furthermore, a family’s income tends to vary over its life cycle: most people earn considerably less in their early working years than they will later in life, then experience a considerable drop in income when they retire. Consequently, the numbers in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch11/table_11_1.html">Table 11-1</span>, which combine young workers, mature workers, and retirees, show more inequality than would a table that compares families of similar ages.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p79"><p>Despite these qualifications, there is a considerable amount of genuine inequality in the United States. In fact, inequality not only persists for long periods of time for individuals, it extends across generations. The children of poor parents are much more likely to be poor than the children of affluent parents, and vice versa—a correlation that is even stronger in the United States than in other rich countries. Moreover, the fact that families’ incomes fluctuate from year to year isn’t entirely good news. Measures of inequality in a given year <em>do</em> overstate true inequality. But those year-to-year fluctuations are part of a problem that worries even affluent families—economic insecurity.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p80"><p>As we stated earlier, although the rationale for the welfare state rests in part on the social benefits of reducing poverty and inequality, it also rests in part on the benefits of reducing economic insecurity, which afflicts even relatively well-off families.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p81"><p>One form economic insecurity takes is the risk of a sudden loss of income, which usually happens when a family member loses a job and either spends an extended period without work or is forced to take a new job that pays considerably less. In a given year, according to recent estimates, about one in six American families will see their income cut in half from the previous year. Related estimates show that the percentage of people who find themselves below the poverty threshold for at least one year over the course of a decade is several times higher than the percentage of people below the poverty threshold in any given year.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p82"><p>Even if a family doesn’t face a loss in income, it can face a surge in expenses. Until implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014, the most common reason for such surges was a medical problem that required expensive treatment, such as heart disease or cancer. In fact, in 2013 it was estimated that 60 percent of the personal bankruptcies of Americans were due to medical expenses. The rise in medical-bill bankruptcies—up nearly 50 percent from 46 percent in 2001, and on up to 62 percent in 2007—was a major source of support for the passage of the ACA.</p></div>

</div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p87"><p>After 1980, however, incomes grew much more quickly at the top than in the middle, and more quickly in the middle than at the bottom. So inequality has increased substantially since 1980. Overall, inflation-adjusted income for families in the top quintile rose 55% between 1980 and 2014, while actually falling slightly for families in the bottom quintile.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p88"><p>Although detailed data on income distribution aren’t available before 1947, economists have instead used other information like income tax data to estimate the share of income going to the top 10% of the population all the way back to 1917. Panel (b) of <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch11/KrugESS4e_fig_11_02.html">Figure 11-2</span> shows this measure from 1917 to 2014. These data, like the more detailed data available since 1947, show that American inequality was more or less stable between 1947 and the late 1970s but has risen substantially since.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p89"><p>The longer-term data also show that the relatively equal distribution of 1947 was something new. In the late nineteenth century, often referred to as the Gilded Age, American income was very unequally distributed. This high level of inequality persisted into the 1930s. But inequality declined sharply between the late 1930s and the end of World War II. In a famous paper, Claudia Goldin and Robert Margo, two economic historians, dubbed this narrowing of income inequality the <em>Great Compression</em>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p90"><p>The Great Compression roughly coincided with World War II, a period during which the U.S. government imposed special controls on wages and prices. Evidence indicates that these controls were applied in ways that reduced inequality—for example, it was much easier for employers to get approval to increase the wages of their lowest-paid employees than to increase executive salaries. What remains puzzling is that the equality imposed by wartime controls lasted for decades after those controls were lifted in 1946.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_324"><p>324</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p91"><p>Since the 1970s, as we’ve already seen, inequality has increased substantially. In fact, pre-tax income appears to be as unequally distributed in America today as it was in the 1920s, prompting many commentators to describe the current state of the nation as a new Gilded Age—albeit one in which the effects of inequality are moderated by taxes and the existence of the welfare state.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p92"><p>There is intense debate among economists about the causes of this widening inequality.</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bullet" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-list-3">
<li><div data-block_type="bx-2-bl-f" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p93"><p>The most popular explanation is rapid technological change, which has increased the demand for highly skilled or talented workers more rapidly than the demand for other workers, leading to a rise in the wage gap between the highly skilled and other workers.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bx-2-bl-mid" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p94"><p>Growing international trade may also have contributed by allowing the United States to import labor-intensive products from low-wage countries rather than making them domestically, reducing the demand for less skilled American workers and depressing their wages.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bx-2-bl-l" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p95"><p>Rising immigration may be yet another source. On average, immigrants have lower education levels than native-born workers and increase the supply of low-skilled labor while depressing low-skilled wages.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch11-p96"><p>However, these explanations, fail to account for one key feature: much of the rise in inequality doesn’t reflect a rising gap between highly educated workers and those with less education but rather growing differences among highly educated workers themselves. For example, schoolteachers and top business executives have similarly high levels of education, but executive paychecks have risen dramatically and teachers’ salaries have not. For some reason, a few “superstars”—a group that includes literal superstars in the entertainment and sports worlds but also such groups as Wall Street traders and top corporate executives—now earn much higher incomes than was the case a generation ago. It’s still unclear what caused the change.</p></div>
