<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p150"><p>No, not really. Trade deficits and their opposite, trade surpluses, are macroeconomic phenomena. They’re the result of situations in which the whole is very different from the sum of its parts. You might think that countries with highly productive workers or widely desired products and services to sell run trade surpluses but countries with unproductive workers or poor-quality products and services run deficits. But the reality is that there’s no simple relationship between the success of an economy and whether it runs trade surpluses or deficits.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p151"><p>In <span data-type="link" data-href="Chapter02.xml">Chapter 2</span> we learned that international trade is the result of comparative advantage: countries export goods they’re relatively good at producing and import goods they’re not as good at producing. That’s why the United States exports wheat and imports coffee. What the concept of comparative advantage doesn’t explain, however, is why the value of a country’s imports is sometimes much larger than the value of its exports, or vice versa.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p152"><p>So what does determine whether a country runs a trade surplus or a trade deficit? In <span data-type="link" data-href="Chapter20.xml">Chapter 20</span> we’ll learn the surprising answer: the determinants of the overall balance between exports and imports lie in decisions about savings and investment spending—spending on goods like machinery and factories that are in turn used to produce goods and services for consumers. Countries with high investment spending relative to savings run trade deficits; countries with low investment spending relative to savings run trade surpluses.</p></div>

A negative current account balance, as shown here, means the country is running a trade deficit. As you can see, after Spain switched to the euro it began running large trade deficits, which at their peak were more than 10% of gross domestic product. After 2008, however, the trade deficit began shrinking rapidly, and by 2013 Spain was running a small surplus which continued into early 2016.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p157"><p>Did this mean that Spain’s economy was doing badly in the mid-2000s, and better thereafter? Just the opposite. When Spain adopted the euro, foreign investors became highly optimistic about its prospects, and money poured into the country, fueling rapid economic expansion. At the heart of this expansion was a huge housing boom, led in particular by the construction of holiday homes along Spain’s famed Mediterranean coast.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p158"><p>Unfortunately, this epic boom eventually turned into an epic bust, and the inflows of foreign capital into Spain dried up. One consequence was that Spain could no longer run large trade deficits, and by 2013 was forced into running a surplus. Another consequence was a severe recession, leading to very high unemployment—including the unemployment of Javier Diaz, the jobless graduate we described at the start of this chapter.</p></div>
