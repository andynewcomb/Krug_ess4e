<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p76"><p>Between 1929 and 1933 there was a sharp fall in aggregate demand—a reduction in the quantity of goods and services demanded at any given price level. One consequence of the economy-wide decline in demand was a fall in the prices of most goods and services. By 1933, the GDP deflator (one of the price indexes we defined in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch13_1.html">Chapter 13</span>) was 26% below its 1929 level, and other indexes were down by similar amounts. A second consequence was a decline in the output of most goods and services: by 1933, real GDP was 27% below its 1929 level. A third consequence, closely tied to the fall in real GDP, was a surge in the unemployment rate from 3% to 25%.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p78"><p>The association between the plunge in real GDP and the plunge in prices wasn’t an accident.

(As you will recall, we use real GDP to measure aggregate output. So we’ll often use the two terms interchangeably.) More specifically, between 1929 and 1933 the U.S. economy moved down its <em>short-run aggregate supply curve.</em></p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p79"><p>The period from 1929 to 1933 demonstrated that there is a positive relationship in the short run between the aggregate price level and the quantity of aggregate output supplied. That is, a rise in the aggregate price level is associated with a rise in the quantity of aggregate output supplied, other things equal; a fall in the aggregate price level is associated with a fall in the quantity of aggregate output supplied, other things equal.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p80"><p>To understand why this positive relationship exists, consider the most basic question facing a producer: is producing a unit of output profitable or not? Let’s define profit per unit:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p81"><p><strong>(16-2)</strong> Profit per unit of output =</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p82"><p>Price per unit of output − Production cost per unit of output</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p83"><p>Thus, the answer to the question depends on whether the price the producer receives for a unit of output is greater or less than the cost of producing that unit of output. At any given point in time, many of the costs producers face are fixed per unit of output and can’t be changed for an extended period of time. Typically, the largest source of inflexible production cost is the wages paid to workers. <em>Wages</em> here refers to all forms of worker compensation, such as employer-paid health care and retirement benefits in addition to earnings.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p85"><p>Wages are typically an inflexible production cost because the dollar amount of any given wage paid, called the <strong>nominal wage,</strong> is often determined by contracts that were signed some time ago. And even when there are no formal contracts, there are often informal agreements between management and workers, making companies reluctant to change wages in response to economic conditions. For example, companies usually will not reduce wages during poor economic times—unless the downturn has been particularly long and severe—for fear of generating worker resentment. Correspondingly, they typically won’t raise wages during better economic times—until they are at risk of losing workers to competitors—because they don’t want to encourage workers to routinely demand higher wages.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p87"><p>As a result of both formal and informal agreements, then, the economy is characterized by <strong>sticky wages:</strong> nominal wages that are slow to fall even in the face of high unemployment and slow to rise even in the face of labor shortages. It’s important to note, however, that nominal wages cannot be sticky forever: ultimately, formal contracts and informal agreements will be renegotiated to take into account changed economic circumstances. As the Pitfalls later in the chapter explains, how long it takes for nominal wages to become flexible is an integral component of what distinguishes the short run from the long run.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p88"><p>To understand how the fact that many costs are fixed in nominal terms gives rise to an upward-sloping short-run aggregate supply curve, it’s helpful to know that prices are set somewhat differently in different kinds of markets. In <em>perfectly competitive markets,</em> producers take prices as given; in <em>imperfectly competitive markets,</em> producers have some ability to choose the prices they charge. In both kinds of markets, there is a short-run positive relationship between prices and output, but for slightly different reasons.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p89"><p>Let’s start with the behavior of producers in perfectly competitive markets; remember, they take the price as given. Imagine that, for some reason, the aggregate price level falls, which means that the price received by the typical producer of a final good or service falls. Because many production costs are fixed in the short run, production cost per unit of output doesn’t fall by the same proportion as the fall in the price of output. So the profit per unit of output declines, leading perfectly competitive producers to reduce the quantity supplied in the short run.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p90"><p>But suppose that for some reason the aggregate price level rises. As a result, the typical producer receives a higher price for its final good or service. Again, many production costs are fixed in the short run, so production cost per unit of output doesn’t rise by the same proportion as the rise in the price of a unit. And since the typical perfectly competitive producer takes the price as given, profit per unit of output rises and output increases.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p91"><p>Now consider an imperfectly competitive producer that is able to set its own price. If there is a rise in the demand for this producer’s product, it will be able to sell more at any given price. Given stronger demand for its products, it will probably choose to increase its prices as well as its output, as a way of increasing profit per unit of output. In fact, industry analysts often talk about variations in an industry’s “pricing power”: when demand is strong, firms with pricing power are able to raise prices—and they do.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p92"><p>Conversely, if there is a fall in demand, firms will normally try to limit the fall in their sales by cutting prices.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p94"><p>Both the responses of firms in perfectly competitive industries and those of firms in imperfectly competitive industries lead to an upward-sloping relationship between aggregate output and the aggregate price level.

</h3>

<div data-block_type="bx3-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p97"><p>Most macroeconomists agree that the basic picture shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16.xml#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-fig-5">Figure 16-3</span> is correct: there is, other things equal, a positive short-run relationship between the aggregate price level and aggregate output. But many would argue that the details are a bit more complicated.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p98"><p>So far we’ve stressed a difference in the behavior of the aggregate price level and the behavior of nominal wages. That is, we’ve said that the aggregate price level is flexible but nominal wages are sticky in the short run. Although this assumption is a good way to explain why the short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, empirical data on wages and prices don’t wholly support a sharp distinction between flexible prices of final goods and services and sticky nominal wages.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p99"><p>On one side, some nominal wages are in fact flexible even in the short run because some workers are not covered by a contract or informal agreement with their employers. Since some nominal wages are sticky but others are flexible, we observe that the <em>average nominal wage—</em>the nominal wage averaged over all workers in the economy—falls when there is a steep rise in unemployment. For example, nominal wages fell substantially in the early years of the Great Depression.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p100"><p>On the other side, some prices of final goods and services are sticky rather than flexible. For example, some firms, particularly the makers of luxury or name-brand goods, are reluctant to cut prices even when demand falls. Instead they prefer to cut output even if their profit per unit hasn’t declined.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p101"><p>These complications, as we’ve said, don’t change the basic picture. When the aggregate price level falls, some producers cut output because the nominal wages they pay are sticky. And some producers don’t cut their prices in the face of a falling aggregate price level, preferring instead to reduce their output. In both cases, the positive relationship between the aggregate price level and aggregate output is maintained. So, in the end, the short-run aggregate supply curve is still upward sloping.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_450"><p>450</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p102"><p>To understand why the short-run aggregate supply curve can shift, it’s important to recall that producers make output decisions based on their profit per unit of output. The short-run aggregate supply curve illustrates the relationship between the aggregate price level and aggregate output: because some production costs are fixed in the short run, a change in the aggregate price level leads to a change in producers’ profit per unit of output and, in turn, leads to a change in aggregate output. But other factors besides the aggregate price level can affect profit per unit and, in turn, aggregate output. It is changes in these other factors that will shift the short-run aggregate supply curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p103"><p>To develop some intuition, suppose that something happens that raises production costs—say, an increase in the price of oil. At any given price of output, a producer now earns a smaller profit per unit of output. As a result, producers reduce the quantity supplied at any given aggregate price level, and the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the left. If, in contrast, something happens that lowers production costs—say, a fall in the nominal wage—a producer now earns a higher profit per unit of output at any given price of output. This leads producers to increase the quantity of aggregate output supplied at any given aggregate price level, and the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the right.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p104"><p>Now we’ll discuss some of the important factors that affect producers’ profit per unit and so can lead to shifts of the short-run aggregate supply curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p105"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Changes in Commodity Prices</strong></span> In this chapter’s opening story, we described how a surge in the price of oil caused problems for the U.S. economy in the 1970s and early in 2008. Oil is a commodity, a standardized input bought and sold in bulk quantities. An increase in the price of a commodity—oil—raised production costs across the economy and reduced the quantity of aggregate output supplied at any given aggregate price level, shifting the short-run aggregate supply curve to the left. Conversely, a decline in commodity prices reduces production costs, leading to an increase in the quantity supplied at any given aggregate price level and a rightward shift of the short-run aggregate supply curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p106"><p>Why isn’t the influence of commodity prices already captured by the short-run aggregate supply curve? Because commodities—unlike, say, soft drinks—are not a final good, their prices are not included in the calculation of the aggregate price level. Further, commodities represent a significant cost of production to most suppliers, just like nominal wages do. So changes in commodity prices have large impacts on production costs. And in contrast to noncommodities, the prices of commodities can sometimes change drastically due to industry-specific shocks to supply—such as wars in the Middle East or rising Chinese demand that leaves less oil for the United States.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_451"><p>451</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p107"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Changes in Nominal Wages</strong></span> At any given point in time, the dollar wages of many workers are fixed because they are set by contracts or informal agreements made in the past. Nominal wages can change, however, once enough time has passed for contracts and informal agreements to be renegotiated. Suppose, for example, that there is an economy-wide rise in the cost of health care insurance premiums paid by employers as part of employees’ wages. From the employers’ perspective, this is equivalent to a rise in nominal wages because it is an increase in employer-paid compensation. So this rise in nominal wages increases production costs and shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve to the left. Conversely, suppose there is an economy-wide fall in the cost of such premiums. This is equivalent to a fall in nominal wages from the point of view of employers; it reduces production costs and shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p108"><p>An important historical fact is that during the 1970s the surge in the price of oil had the indirect effect of also raising nominal wages. This “knock-on” effect occurred because many wage contracts included <em>cost-of-living allowances</em> that automatically raised the nominal wage when consumer prices increased. Through this channel, the surge in the price of oil—which led to an increase in overall consumer prices—ultimately caused a rise in nominal wages.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p109"><p>So the economy, in the end, experienced two leftward shifts of the aggregate supply curve: the first generated by the initial surge in the price of oil, the second generated by the induced increase in nominal wages. The negative effect on the economy of rising oil prices was greatly magnified through the cost-of-living allowances in wage contracts. Today, cost-of-living allowances in wage contracts are rare.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p110"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Changes in Productivity</strong></span> An increase in productivity means that a worker can produce more units of output with the same quantity of inputs. For example, the introduction of bar-code scanners in retail stores greatly increased the ability of a single worker to stock, inventory, and resupply store shelves. As a result, the cost to a store of “producing” a dollar of sales fell and profit rose. And, correspondingly, the quantity supplied increased. (Think of Walmart and the increase in the number of its stores as an increase in aggregate supply.) So a rise in productivity, whatever the source, increases producers’ profits and shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p111"><p>Conversely, a fall in productivity—say, due to new regulations that require workers to spend more time filling out forms—reduces the number of units of output a worker can produce with the same quantity of inputs. Consequently, the cost per unit of output rises, profit falls, and quantity supplied falls. This shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve to the left.</p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p113"><p>We’ve just seen that in the short run a fall in the aggregate price level leads to a decline in the quantity of aggregate output supplied because nominal wages are sticky in the short run. But, as we mentioned earlier, contracts and informal agreements are renegotiated in the long run. So in the long run, nominal wages—like the aggregate price level—are flexible, not sticky. This fact greatly alters the long-run relationship between the aggregate price level and aggregate supply. In fact, in the long run the aggregate price level has <em>no</em> effect on the quantity of aggregate output supplied.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p114"><p>To see why, let’s conduct a thought experiment. Imagine that you could wave a magic wand—or maybe a magic bar-code scanner—and cut <em>all prices</em> in the economy in half at the same time. By “all prices” we mean the prices of all inputs, including nominal wages, as well as the prices of final goods and services. What would happen to aggregate output, given that the aggregate price level has been halved and all input prices, including nominal wages, have been halved?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_452"><p>452</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p115"><p>The answer is: nothing. Consider Equation 16-2 again: each producer would receive a lower price for its product, but costs would fall by the same proportion. As a result, every unit of output profitable to produce before the change in prices would still be profitable to produce after the change in prices. So a halving of <em>all</em> prices in the economy has no effect on the economy’s aggregate output. In other words, changes in the aggregate price level now have no effect on the quantity of aggregate output supplied.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p116"><p>In reality, of course, no one can change all prices by the same proportion at the same time. But we’ll now consider the <em>long run, the period of time over which all prices are fully flexible.</em> In the long run, inflation or deflation has the same effect as someone changing all prices by the same proportion. <em>As a result, changes in the aggregate price level do not change the quantity of aggregate output supplied in the long run.</em> That’s because changes in the aggregate price level will, in the long run, be accompanied by equal proportional changes in <em>all</em> input prices, including nominal wages.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p123"><p>As you can see, U.S. potential output has risen steadily over time—implying a series of rightward shifts of the <em>LRAS</em> curve. What has caused these rightward shifts? The answer lies in the factors related to long-run growth that we discussed in <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch15_1.html">Chapter 15</span>, such as increases in physical capital and human capital as well as technological progress. Over the long run, as the size of the labor force and the productivity of labor both rise, the level of real GDP that the economy is capable of producing also rises. Indeed, one way to think about long-run economic growth is that it is the growth in the economy’s potential output. We generally think of the long-run aggregate supply curve as shifting to the right over time as an economy experiences long-run growth.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-t" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p128"><p><strong>ARE WE THERE YET? WHAT THE LONG RUN REALLY MEANS</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p129"><p>We’ve used the term <em>long run</em> in two different contexts. In the previous chapter we focused on <em>long-run economic growth</em> that takes place over decades. In this chapter we introduced the <em>long-run aggregate supply curve,</em> which depicts the economy’s potential output: the level of aggregate output that the economy would produce if all prices, including nominal wages, were fully flexible. It might seem that we’re using the same term, <em>long run,</em> for two different concepts. But we aren’t: these two concepts are really the same thing.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx1-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p130"><p>Because the economy always tends to return to potential output in the long run, actual aggregate output <em>fluctuates around</em> potential output, rarely getting too far from it. As a result, the economy’s rate of growth over long periods of time—say, decades—is very close to the rate of growth of potential output. And potential output growth is determined by the factors we analyzed in the chapter on long-run economic growth. So that means that the “long run” of long-run growth and the “long run” of the long-run aggregate supply curve coincide.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch16-p131"><p>But that is not the end of the story. If the economy is on the short-run but not the long-run aggregate supply curve, the short-run aggregate supply curve will shift over time until the economy is at a point where both curves cross—a point where actual aggregate output is equal to potential output.</p></div>
