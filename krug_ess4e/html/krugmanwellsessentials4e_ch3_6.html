<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p210"><p>The huge fall in the price of natural gas from $14 to $2 per BTU from 2006 to 2015 may have come as a surprise to consumers, but to suppliers it was no surprise at all. Suppliers knew that advances in drilling technology had opened up vast reserves of natural gas that had been too costly to tap in the past. And, predictably, an increase in supply reduces the equilibrium price.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p211"><p>The adoption of improved drilling technology is an example of an event that shifted the supply curve for a good without having an effect on the demand curve. There are many such events. There are also events that shift the demand curve without shifting the supply curve. For example, a medical report that chocolate is good for you increases the demand for chocolate but does not affect the supply. Events often shift either the supply curve or the demand curve, but not both; it is therefore useful to ask what happens in each case.</p></div>

At the original market price <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>, this market is no longer in equilibrium: a shortage occurs because the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied.

This illustrates another general principle: <em>When demand for a good or service decreases, the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity of the good or service both fall.</em></p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p218"><p>For most goods and services, it is a bit easier to predict changes in supply than changes in demand. Physical factors that affect supply, like weather or the availability of inputs, are easier to get a handle on than the fickle tastes that affect demand. Still, with supply as with demand, what we can best predict are the <em>effects</em> of shifts of the supply curve.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p219"><p>As we mentioned in the opening story, improved drilling technology significantly increased the supply of natural gas from 2006 onward. <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch3/KrugESS4e_fig_3_15.html">Figure 3-15</span> shows how this shift affected the market equilibrium. The original equilibrium is at <em>E</em><sub>1</sub>, the point of intersection of the original supply curve, <em>S</em><sub>1</sub>, with an equilibrium price <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> and equilibrium quantity <em>Q</em><sub>1</sub>. As a result of the improved technology, supply increases and <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> shifts <em>rightward</em> to <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>. At the original price <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>, a surplus of natural gas now exists and the market is no longer in equilibrium. The surplus causes a fall in price and an increase in the quantity demanded, a downward movement along the demand curve. The new equilibrium is at <em>E</em><sub>2</sub>, with an equilibrium price <em>P</em><sub>2</sub> and an equilibrium quantity <em>Q</em><sub>2</sub><em>.</em> In the new equilibrium <em>E</em><sub>2</sub>, the price is lower and the equilibrium quantity is higher than before. This can be stated as a general principle: <em>When supply of a good or service increases, the equilibrium price of the good or service falls and the equilibrium quantity of the good or service rises.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx1-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p221"><p>When the price of some good or service changes, in general, we can say that this reflects a change in either supply or demand. But it is easy to get confused about which one. A helpful clue is the direction of change in the quantity. If the quantity sold changes in the <em>same</em> direction as the price—for example, if both the price and the quantity rise—this suggests that the demand curve has shifted. If the price and the quantity move in <em>opposite</em> directions, the likely cause is a shift of the supply curve.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p222"><p>What happens to the market when supply falls? A fall in supply leads to a <em>leftward</em> shift of the supply curve. At the original price a shortage now exists; as a result, the equilibrium price rises and the quantity demanded falls. This describes what happened to the market for natural gas after Hurricane Katrina damaged natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2006. We can formulate a general principle: <em>When supply of a good or service decreases, the equilibrium price of the good or service rises and the equilibrium quantity of the good or service falls.</em></p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p224"><p>Finally, it sometimes happens that events shift <em>both</em> the demand and supply curves at the same time. This is not unusual; in real life, supply curves and demand curves for many goods and services shift quite often because the economic environment continually changes. <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch3/KrugESS4e_fig_3_16.html">Figure 3-16</span> illustrates two examples of simultaneous shifts. In both panels there is an increase in supply—that is, a rightward shift of the supply curve from <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>—representing, for example, adoption of an improved drilling technology. Notice that the rightward shift in panel (a) is larger than the one in panel (b): we can suppose that panel (a) represents a small, incremental change in technology while panel (b) represents a big advance in technology. Both panels show a decrease in demand—that is, a leftward shift from <em>D</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>D</em><sub>2</sub>. Also notice that the leftward shift in panel (a) is relatively larger than the one in panel (b): we can suppose that panel (a) reflects the effect on demand of a deep recession in the overall economy, while panel (b) reflects the effect of a mild winter.</p></div>

Much to the dismay of owners of cotton textile mills, this is exactly what happened in early 2011, when a huge surge in the price of raw cotton peaked, followed by an equally spectacular fall. In situations like these, consumers become their own worst enemy, engaging in what is called <em>panic buying:</em> rushing to purchase more of a good because its price has gone up, which precipitates only a further price rise and more panic buying. So how did cotton buyers find themselves in this predicament in 2011? And what finally got them out of it?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p235"><p>The process had, in fact, been started by real events that occurred years earlier. By 2010, demand for cotton had rebounded sharply from lows set during the global financial crisis of 2006–2007. In addition, greater demand for cotton clothing in countries with rapidly growing middle classes, like China, added to the increased demand for cotton. This had the effect of shifting the demand curve rightward.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p236"><p>At the same time there were significant supply reductions to the worldwide market for cotton. India, the second largest exporter of cotton (an <em>exporter</em> is a seller of a good to foreign buyers), had imposed restrictions on the sale of its cotton abroad in order to aid its own textile mills. And Pakistan, China, and Australia, which were big growers of cotton, experienced widespread flooding that significantly reduced their cotton crops. The Indian export restrictions and the floods in cotton-producing areas had the effect of shifting the supply curve leftward.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p237"><p>So, as shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch3/KrugESS4e_fig_3_17.html">Figure 3-17</span>, while cotton had traded at between $0.35 and $0.60 per pound from 2000 to 2010, it surged to more than $2.40 per pound in early 2011—up more than 200% in one year. As high prices for cotton sparked panic buying, the demand curve shifted further rightward, further feeding the buying frenzy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_94"><p>94</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch3-p238"><p>Yet by the end of 2011, cotton prices had plummeted to $0.86 per pound. What happened? A number of things, illustrating the forces of supply and demand. First, demand fell as clothing manufacturers, unwilling to pass on huge price increases to their customers, shifted to less expensive fabrics like polyester. Second, supply increased as farmers planted more acreage of cotton in hopes of garnering high prices. As the effects of supply and demand became obvious, buyers stopped panicking and cotton prices finally fell back down to earth.</p></div>
