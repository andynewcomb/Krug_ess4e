<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p64"><p>The Great Depression was by far the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. But although the economy managed to avoid catastrophe for the rest of the twentieth century, it has experienced many ups and downs.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p65"><p>It’s true that the ups have consistently been bigger than the downs: a chart of any of the major numbers used to track the U.S. economy shows a strong upward trend over time. For example, <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch12/KrugESS4e_fig_12_02.html">Figure 12-2</span> shows total U.S. private-sector employment (the total number of jobs offered by private businesses) measured along the left vertical axis, with the data from 1985 to 2014 given by the purple line. The graph also shows the index of industrial production (a measure of the total output of U.S. factories) measured along the right vertical axis, with the data from 1985 to 2014 given by the red line. Both private-sector employment and industrial production were much higher at the end of this period than at the beginning, and in most years both measures rose.</p></div>

</h3>

<div data-block_type="bx3-txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p77"><p>You may be wondering how recessions and expansions are defined. The truth is that there are no exact definitions!</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p78"><p>In many countries, economists adopt the rule that a recession is a period of at least two consecutive quarters (a quarter is three months) during which the total output of the economy shrinks. The two-consecutive-quarters requirement is designed to avoid classifying brief hiccups in the economy’s performance, with no lasting significance, as recessions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p79"><p>Sometimes, however, this seems too strict. For example, three months of sharply declining output, then three months of slightly positive growth, then another three months of rapid decline, should surely be considered to have endured a nine-month recession.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p80"><p>In the United States, we assign the task of determining when a recession begins and ends to an independent panel of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). This panel looks at a variety of economic indicators, with the main focus on employment and production. But, ultimately, the panel makes a judgment call.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx3-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p81"><p>Sometimes this judgment is controversial. In fact, there is lingering controversy over the 2001 recession. According to the NBER, that recession began in March 2001 and ended in November 2001 when output began rising. Some critics argue, however, that the recession really began several months earlier, when industrial production began falling. Other critics argue that the recession didn’t really end in 2001 because employment continued to fall and the job market remained weak for another year and a half.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p82"><p>Not many people complain about the business cycle when the economy is expanding. Recessions, however, create a great deal of pain.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p83"><p>The most important effect of a recession is its effect on the ability of workers to find and hold jobs. The most widely used indicator of conditions in the labor market is the <em>unemployment rate.</em> We’ll explain how that rate is calculated in <span data-type="link" data-href="Chapter14.xml">Chapter 14</span>, but for now it’s enough to say that a high unemployment rate tells us that jobs are scarce and a low unemployment rate tells us that jobs are easy to find.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p85"><p>Because recessions cause many people to lose their jobs and make it hard to find new ones, they hurt the standard of living of many families.

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p89"><p>Modern macroeconomics largely came into being as a response to the worst recession in history—the 43-month downturn that began in 1929 and continued into 1933, ushering in the Great Depression. The havoc wreaked by the 1929–1933 recession spurred economists to search both for understanding and for solutions: they wanted to know how such things could happen and how to prevent them.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_350"><p>350</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p90"><p>As explained earlier, the work of John Maynard Keynes suggested that monetary and fiscal policies could be used to mitigate the effects of recessions, and to this day governments turn to Keynesian policies when recession strikes. Later work, notably that of another great macroeconomist, Milton Friedman, led to a consensus that it’s important to rein in booms as well as to fight slumps. So modern policy makers try to “smooth out” the business cycle. They haven’t been completely successful, as a look back at <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch12/KrugESS4e_fig_12_02.html">Figure 12-2</span> makes clear. It’s widely believed, however, that policy guided by macroeconomic analysis has helped make the economy more stable.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p93"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">T</span>he alternation of recessions and expansions seems to be an enduring feature of economic life. However, not all business cycles are created equal. In particular, some recessions have been much worse than others.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p94"><p>Let’s compare the two most recent U.S. recessions: the 2001 recession and the Great Recession of 2007–2009. These recessions differed in duration: the first lasted only eight months, the second more than twice as long. Even more important, however, they differed greatly in depth.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch12-p95"><p>In <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch12/KrugESS4e_fig_12_05.html">Figure 12-5</span> we compare the depth of the recessions by looking at what happened to industrial production over the months after the recession began. In each case, production is measured as a percentage of its level at the recession’s start. Thus the line for the 2007–2009 recession shows that industrial production eventually fell to about 85% of its initial level.</p></div>
