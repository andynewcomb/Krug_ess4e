<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p90"><p>An expansionary fiscal policy, like the 2009 U.S. stimulus, pushes the aggregate demand curve to the right. A contractionary fiscal policy, like Lyndon Johnson’s tax surcharge, pushes the aggregate demand curve to the left. For policy makers, however, knowing the direction of the shift isn’t enough: they need estimates of <em>how much</em> a given policy will shift the aggregate demand curve. To get these estimates, they use the concept of the multiplier.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p93"><p>The firms that produce the goods and services purchased by the government earn revenues that flow to households in the form of wages, profits, interest, and rent. This increase in disposable income leads to a rise in consumer spending. The rise in consumer spending, in turn, induces firms to increase output, leading to a further rise in disposable income, which leads to another round of consumer spending increases, and so on. In this case, the <em>multiplier</em> is the ratio of the total change in real GDP caused by the change in the government’s purchases of goods and services. More generally, real GDP can change with any <em>autonomous change in aggregate spending,</em> not just a change in consumer spending. An <strong>autonomous change in aggregate spending</strong> is the initial rise or fall in the desired level of spending by firms, households, or government at a given level of GDP.

To answer this question, we need to introduce the concept of the <strong>marginal propensity to consume,</strong> or <strong><em>MPC:</em></strong> the increase in consumer spending when disposable income rises by $1. When consumer spending changes because of a rise or fall in disposable income, <em>MPC</em> is that change in consumer spending divided by the change in disposable income:</p></div>

Also assume that the aggregate price level is fixed, so that any increase in nominal GDP is also a rise in real GDP, and assume that the interest rate is fixed. In this case, the multiplier is 1/(1 − <em>MPC</em>). So, if the marginal propensity to consume is 0.5, the multiplier is 1/(1 − 0.5) = 1/0.5 = 2. Given a multiplier of 2, a $50 billion increase in government purchases of goods and services would increase real GDP by $100 billion. Of that $100 billion, $50 billion is the initial effect from the increase in <em>G,</em> and the remaining $50 billion is the subsequent effect arising from the increase in consumer spending.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p98"><p>What happens if government purchases of goods and services are instead reduced?

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p99"><p>Expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy need not take the form of changes in government purchases of goods and services. Governments can also change transfer payments or taxes. In general, however, a change in government transfers or taxes shifts the aggregate demand curve by <em>less</em> than an equal-sized change in government purchases, resulting in a smaller effect on real GDP.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p100"><p>To see why, imagine that instead of spending $50 billion on building bridges, the government simply hands out $50 billion in the form of government transfers. In this case, there is no direct effect on aggregate demand, as there was with government purchases of goods and services. Real GDP goes up only because households spend some of that $50 billion—and they probably won’t spend it all.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p102"><p>However, the first-round effect of the transfer program is smaller; because we have assumed that the <em>MPC</em> is 0.5, only $25 billion of the $50 billion is spent, with the other $25 billion saved. And as a result, all the further rounds are smaller, too. In the end, the transfer payment increases real GDP by only $50 billion. In comparison, a $50 billion increase in government purchases produces a $100 billion increase in real GDP.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p103"><p>Overall, when expansionary fiscal policy takes the form of a rise in transfer payments, real GDP may rise by either more or less than the initial government outlay—that is, the multiplier may be either more or less than 1 depending upon the size of the <em>MPC.</em> In <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch14/table_14_1.html">Table 17-1</span>, with an <em>MPC</em> equal to 0.5, the multiplier is exactly 1: a $50 billion rise in transfer payments increases real GDP by $50 billion.

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p106"><p>We should also note that taxes introduce a further complication—they typically change the size of the multiplier. That’s because in the real world governments rarely impose <strong>lump-sum taxes,</strong> in which the amount of tax a household owes is independent of its income. With lump-sum taxes there is no change in the multiplier. Instead, the great majority of tax revenue is raised via taxes that are not lump-sum, and so tax revenue depends upon the level of real GDP.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p107"><p>In practice, economists often argue that the size of the multiplier determines <em>who</em> among the population should get tax cuts or increases in government transfers. For example, compare the effects of an increase in unemployment benefits with a cut in taxes on profits distributed to shareholders as dividends. Consumer surveys suggest that the average unemployed worker will spend a higher share of any increase in his or her disposable income than would the average recipient of dividend income. That is, people who are unemployed tend to have a higher <em>MPC</em> than people who own a lot of stocks because the latter tend to be wealthier and tend to save more of any increase in disposable income. If that’s true, a dollar spent on unemployment benefits increases aggregate demand more than a dollar’s worth of dividend tax cuts.</p></div>

<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-sec2-8">How Taxes Affect the Multiplier
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p108"><p>The increase in government tax revenue when real GDP rises isn’t the result of a deliberate decision or action by the government. It’s a consequence of the way the tax laws are written, which causes most sources of government revenue to increase <em>automatically</em> when real GDP goes up. For example, income tax receipts increase when real GDP rises because the amount each individual owes in taxes depends positively on his or her income, and households’ taxable income rises when real GDP rises. Sales tax receipts increase when real GDP rises because people with more income spend more on goods and services. And corporate profit tax receipts increase when real GDP rises because profits increase when the economy expands.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p109"><p>The effect of these automatic increases in tax revenue is to reduce the size of the multiplier. Remember, the multiplier is the result of a chain reaction in which higher real GDP leads to higher disposable income, which leads to higher consumer spending, which leads to further increases in real GDP. The fact that the government siphons off some of any increase in real GDP means that at each stage of this process, the increase in consumer spending is smaller than it would be if taxes weren’t part of the picture. The result is to reduce the multiplier.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p110"><p>Many macroeconomists believe it’s a good thing that in real life taxes reduce the multiplier. In <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch16_1.html">Chapter 16</span> we argued that most, though not all, recessions are the result of negative demand shocks. The same mechanism that causes tax revenue to increase when the economy expands causes it to decrease when the economy contracts. Since tax receipts decrease when real GDP falls, the effects of these negative demand shocks are smaller than they would be if there were no taxes. The decrease in tax revenue reduces the adverse effect of the initial fall in aggregate demand.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p112"><p>The automatic decrease in government tax revenue generated by a fall in real GDP—caused by a decrease in the amount of taxes households pay—acts like an automatic expansionary fiscal policy implemented in the face of a recession. Similarly, when the economy expands, the government finds itself automatically pursuing a contractionary fiscal policy—a tax increase. Government spending and taxation rules that cause fiscal policy to be automatically expansionary when the economy contracts and automatically contractionary when the economy expands, without requiring any deliberate action by policy makers, are called <strong>automatic stabilizers.</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p113"><p>The rules that govern tax collection aren’t the only automatic stabilizers, although they are the most important ones. Some types of government transfers also play a stabilizing role. For example, more people receive unemployment insurance when the economy is depressed than when it is booming. The same is true of Medicaid and food stamps. So transfer payments tend to rise when the economy is contracting and fall when the economy is expanding. Like changes in tax revenue, these automatic changes in transfers tend to reduce the size of the multiplier because the total change in disposable income that results from a given rise or fall in real GDP is smaller.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p114"><p>As in the case of government tax revenue, many macroeconomists believe that it’s a good thing that government transfers reduce the multiplier. Expansionary and contractionary fiscal policies that are the result of automatic stabilizers are widely considered helpful to macroeconomic stabilization because they blunt the extremes of the business cycle.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p120"><p>The problem was that large changes in fiscal policy are fairly rare, and usually happen at the same time other things are taking place, making it hard to separate the effects of spending and taxes from those of other factors. For example, the U.S. drastically increased spending during World War II—but it also instituted rationing of many consumer goods, more or less banned construction of new houses, and so on. So the effects of the spending increase are hard to distinguish from the overall conversion from a peacetime to a war economy.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p121"><p>Recent events have, however, offered considerable new evidence. After 2009 several European countries found themselves facing debt crises, so they were forced to turn to the rest of Europe for aid. A condition of this aid was <em>austerity</em>—sharp cuts in spending plus tax increases. By comparing the economic performance of countries that were forced into austerity with that of countries that weren’t, we get a relatively clear view of the effects of changes in spending and taxes.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p132"><p>Headlines about the government’s budget tend to focus on just one point: whether the government is running a surplus or a deficit and, in either case, how big. People usually think of surpluses as good: when the federal government ran a record surplus in 2000, many people regarded it as a cause for celebration.

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p134"><p>What do we mean by surpluses and deficits? The budget balance is the difference between the government’s revenue, in the form of tax revenue, and its spending, both on goods and services and on government transfers, in a given year. That is, the budget balance—savings by government—is defined by <span data-type="link" data-href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p135">Equation 17-3</span>:</p></div>
<div data-block_type="eq" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p135"><p><strong>(17-3)</strong> <em>S<sub>Government</sub></em> = <em>T</em> − <em>G</em> − <em>TR</em></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p136"><p>where <em>T</em> is the value of tax revenues, <em>G</em> is government purchases of goods and services, and <em>TR</em> is the value of government transfers. A budget surplus is a positive budget balance and a budget deficit is a negative budget balance.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p137"><p>Other things equal, expansionary fiscal policies—increased government purchases of goods and services, higher government transfers, or lower taxes—reduce the budget balance for that year. That is, expansionary fiscal policies make a budget surplus smaller or a budget deficit bigger. Conversely, contractionary fiscal policies—reduced government purchases of goods and services, lower government transfers, or higher taxes—increase the budget balance for that year, making a budget surplus bigger or a budget deficit smaller.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p138"><p>You might think this means that changes in the budget balance can be used to measure fiscal policy. In fact, economists often do just that: they use changes in the budget balance as a “quick-and-dirty” way to assess whether current fiscal policy is expansionary or contractionary. But they always keep in mind two reasons this quick-and-dirty approach is sometimes misleading:</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p142"><p>Historically there has been a strong relationship between the federal government’s budget balance and the business cycle. The budget tends to move into deficit when the economy experiences a recession, but deficits tend to get smaller or even turn into surpluses when the economy is expanding. <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_08.html">Figure 17-8</span> shows the federal budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from 1964 to 2014.

In fact, in the late stages of the long expansion from 1991 to 2000, the deficit actually became negative—the budget deficit became a budget surplus.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p144"><p>Is this relationship between the business cycle and the budget balance evidence that policy makers engage in discretionary fiscal policy, using expansionary fiscal policy during recessions and contractionary fiscal policy during expansions? Not necessarily. To a large extent the relationship in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_09.html">Figure 17-9</span> reflects automatic stabilizers at work. As we saw earlier in the discussion of automatic stabilizers, government tax revenue tends to rise and some government transfers, like unemployment benefit payments, tend to fall when the economy expands. Conversely, government tax revenue tends to fall and some government transfers tend to rise when the economy contracts. So the budget tends to move toward surplus during expansions and toward deficit during recessions even without any deliberate action on the part of policy makers.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p145"><p>In assessing budget policy, it’s often useful to separate movements in the budget balance due to the business cycle from movements due to discretionary fiscal policy changes. The former are affected by automatic stabilizers and the latter by deliberate changes in government purchases, government transfers, or taxes. It’s important to realize that business-cycle effects on the budget balance are temporary: both recessionary gaps (in which real GDP is below potential output) and inflationary gaps (in which real GDP is above potential output) tend to be eliminated in the long run. Removing their effects on the budget balance sheds light on whether the government’s taxing and spending policies are sustainable in the long run. </p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p148"><p>To separate the effect of the business cycle from the effects of other factors, many governments produce an estimate of what the budget balance would be if there were neither a recessionary nor an inflationary gap. The <strong>cyclically adjusted budget balance</strong> is an estimate of what the budget balance would be if real GDP were exactly equal to potential output.

As you can see, the cyclically adjusted budget deficit doesn’t fluctuate as much as the actual budget deficit. In particular, large actual deficits, such as those of 1975, 1983, and 2009, are usually caused in part by a depressed economy. </p></div>

</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p150"><p>As we’ll see in the next section, persistent budget deficits can cause problems for both the government and the economy. Yet politicians are always tempted to run deficits because this allows them to cater to voters by cutting taxes without cutting spending or by increasing spending without increasing taxes. As a result, there are occasional attempts by policy makers to force fiscal discipline by introducing legislation—even a constitutional amendment—forbidding the government from running budget deficits. This is usually stated as a requirement that the budget be “balanced”—that revenues at least equal spending each fiscal year. Would it be a good idea to require a balanced budget annually?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch17_page_491"><p>491</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p151"><p>Most economists don’t think so. They believe that the government should only balance its budget on average—that it should be allowed to run deficits in bad years, offset by surpluses in good years. They don’t believe the government should be forced to run a balanced budget <em>every year</em> because this would undermine the role of taxes and transfers as automatic stabilizers. </p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p152"><p>As we learned earlier, the tendency of tax revenue to fall and transfers to rise when the economy contracts helps to limit the size of recessions. But falling tax revenue and rising transfer payments generated by a downturn in the economy push the budget toward deficit. If constrained by a balanced-budget rule, the government would have to respond to this deficit with contractionary fiscal policies that would tend to deepen a recession.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p153"><p>Yet policy makers concerned about excessive deficits sometimes feel that rigid rules prohibiting—or at least setting an upper limit on—deficits are necessary. As the following Economics in Action explains, Europe has had a lot of trouble reconciling rules to enforce fiscal responsibility with the challenges of short-run fiscal policy.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p156"><p><span data-block_type="dropcap">I</span>n 1999 a group of European nations took a momentous step when they adopted a common currency, the euro, to replace their various national currencies, such as the French franc, the German mark, and the Italian lira. Along with the introduction of the euro came the creation of the European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the whole region.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p157"><p>As part of the agreement creating the new currency, governments of member countries signed on to the European “stability pact.” This agreement required each government to keep its budget deficit—its actual deficit, not a cyclically adjusted number—below 3% of the country’s GDP or face fines. The pact was intended to prevent irresponsible deficit spending arising from political pressure that might eventually undermine the new currency.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p158"><p>The stability pact, however, had a serious downside: in principle, it would force countries to slash spending and/or raise taxes whenever an economic downturn pushed their deficits above the critical level. This would turn fiscal policy into a force that worsens recessions instead of fighting them.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p159"><p>Nonetheless, the stability pact proved impossible to enforce: European nations, including France and even Germany, with its reputation for fiscal probity, simply ignored the rule during the 2001 recession and its aftermath.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p160"><p>In 2011 the Europeans tried again, this time against the background of a severe debt crisis. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy all lost the confidence of investors, who were worried about their ability and/or willingness to repay all their debt—and the efforts of these nations to reduce their deficits seemed likely to push Europe back into recession. Yet a return to the old stability pact didn’t seem to make sense. Among other things, it was clear that the stability pact’s rule on the size of budget deficits would not have done much to prevent the crisis—in 2007 all of the problem debtors except Greece were running deficits under 3% of GDP, with Ireland and Spain actually running surpluses.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p161"><p>So the agreement reached in December 2011 was framed in terms of the “structural” budget balance, more or less corresponding to the cyclically adjusted budget balance as we defined it. According to the new rule, the structural budget balance of each country should be very nearly zero, with deficits not to exceed 0.5% of GDP. This seemed like a much better rule than the old stability pact.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p162"><p>Yet big problems remained. One was the question of how reliable were the estimates of the structural budget balances. Also, the new rule seemed to ban any use of discretionary fiscal policy, under any circumstances. By early 2015 it was clear that this fiscal straight-jacket was a problem: a weakening European economy clearly needed stimulus but the fiscal rule prohibited it.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p163"><p>Before patting themselves on the back over the superiority of their own fiscal rules, Americans should note that the United States has its own version of the original, flawed European stability pact. The federal government’s budget acts as an automatic stabilizer, but 49 of the 50 states are required by their state constitutions to balance their budgets every year. When recession struck in 2008, most states were forced to—guess what?—slash spending and raise taxes in the face of a recession, exactly the wrong thing from a macroeconomic point of view.</p></div>
