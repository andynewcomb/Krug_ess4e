</div></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p236"><p>Up to this point, we have considered only the case of a <strong>single-price monopolist,</strong> one that charges all consumers the same price. As the term suggests, not all monopolists do this. In fact, many if not most monopolists find that they can increase their profits by charging different customers different prices for the same good: they engage in <strong>price discrimination.</strong></p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p237"><p>The most striking example of price discrimination most of us encounter regularly involves airline tickets. Although there are a number of airlines, most routes in the United States are serviced by only one or two carriers, which, as a result, have market power and can set prices. So any regular airline passenger quickly becomes aware that the question “How much will it cost me to fly there?” rarely has a simple answer.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p238"><p>If you are willing to buy a nonrefundable ticket a month in advance and happen to purchase the ticket on Tuesday or Wednesday evening, the round trip may cost only $150—or less if you are a senior citizen or a student. But if you have to go on a business trip tomorrow, which happens to be Tuesday, and come back on Wednesday, the same round trip might cost $550. Yet the business traveler and the visiting grandparent receive the same product—that same cramped seat.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p239"><p>You might object that airlines are not usually monopolists—that in most flight markets the airline industry is an oligopoly. In fact, price discrimination takes place under oligopoly and monopolistic competition as well as monopoly. But it doesn’t happen under perfect competition. And once we’ve seen why monopolists sometimes price-discriminate, we’ll be in a good position to understand why it happens in oligopoly and monopolistic competition, too.</p></div>

<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-sec2-11">The Logic of Price Discrimination
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p240"><p>To get a preliminary view of why price discrimination might be more profitable than charging all consumers the same price, imagine that Air Sunshine offers the only nonstop flights between Bismarck, North Dakota, and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Assume that there are no capacity problems—the airline can fly as many planes as the number of passengers warrants. Also assume that there is no fixed cost. The marginal cost to the airline of providing a seat is $125, however many passengers it carries.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p241"><p>Further assume that the airline knows there are two kinds of potential passengers. First, there are business travelers, 2,000 of whom want to travel between the destinations each week. Second, there are students, 2,000 of whom also want to travel each week.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p242"><p>Will potential passengers take the flight? It depends on the price. The business travelers, it turns out, really need to fly; they will take the plane as long as the price is no more than $550. Since they are flying purely for business, we assume that cutting the price below $550 will not lead to any increase in business travel. The students, however, have less money and more time; if the price goes above $150, they will take the bus. The implied demand curve is shown in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_10.html">Figure 8-10</span>.</p></div>

<div data-type="figure_text">
<span data-type="number">Figure 8.10: </span><span data-type="caption">Air Sunshine has two types of customers, business travelers willing to pay at most $550 per ticket and students willing to pay at most $150 per ticket. There are 2,000 of each kind of customer. Air Sunshine has constant marginal cost of $125 per seat. If Air Sunshine could charge these two types of customers different prices, it would maximize its profit by charging business travelers $550 and students $150 per ticket. It would capture all of the consumer surplus as profit.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p243"><p>So what should the airline do? If it has to charge everyone the same price, its options are limited. It could charge $550; that way it would get as much as possible out of the business travelers but lose the student market. Or it could charge only $150; that way it would get both types of travelers but would make significantly less money from sales to business travelers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p244"><p>We can quickly calculate the profits from each of these alternatives. If the airline charged $550, it would sell 2,000 tickets to the business travelers, earning total revenue of 2,000 × $550 = $1.1 million and incurring costs of 2,000 × $125 = $250,000; so its profit would be $850,000, illustrated by the shaded area <em>B</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_10.html">Figure 8-10</span>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_252"><p>252</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p245"><p>If the airline charged only $150, it would sell 4,000 tickets, receiving revenue of 4,000 × $150 = $600,000 and incurring costs of 4,000 × $125 = $500,000; so its profit would be $100,000. If the airline must charge everyone the same price, charging the higher price and forgoing sales to students is clearly more profitable.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p246"><p>What the airline would really like to do, however, is charge the business travelers the full $550 but offer $150 tickets to the students. That’s a lot less than the price paid by business travelers, but it’s still above marginal cost; so if the airline could sell those extra 2,000 tickets to students, it would make an additional $50,000 in profit. That is, it would make a profit equal to the areas <em>B</em> plus <em>S</em> in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_10.html">Figure 8-10</span>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p247"><p>It would be more realistic to suppose that there is some “give” in the demand of each group: at a price below $550, there would be some increase in business travel; and at a price above $150, some students would still purchase tickets. But this, it turns out, does not do away with the argument for price discrimination.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p248"><p>The important point is that the two groups of consumers differ in their <em>sensitivity to price</em>—that a high price has a larger effect in discouraging purchases by students than by business travelers. As long as different groups of customers respond differently to the price, a monopolist will find that it can capture more consumer surplus and increase its profit by charging them different prices.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt-3" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p249"><p><span data-block_type="h3"><strong>Price Discrimination and Elasticity</strong></span> A more realistic description of the demand that airlines face would not specify particular prices at which different types of travelers would choose to fly. Instead, it would distinguish between the groups on the basis of their sensitivity to the price—their price elasticity of demand.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p250"><p>Suppose that a company sells its product to two easily identifiable groups of people—business travelers and students. It just so happens that business travelers are very insensitive to the price: there is a certain amount of the product they just have to have whatever the price, but they cannot be persuaded to buy much more than that no matter how cheap it is. Students, though, are more flexible: offer a good enough price and they will buy quite a lot, but raise the price too high and they will switch to something else. What should the company do?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p251"><p>The answer is the one already suggested by our simplified example: the company should charge business travelers, with their low price elasticity of demand, a higher price than it charges students, with their high price elasticity of demand.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p252"><p>What would happen if the airline could distinguish between students and business travelers in order to charge each a different price?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p253"><p>Clearly, the airline would charge each group its willingness to pay—that is, the maximum that each group is willing to pay. For business travelers, the willingness to pay is $550; for students, it is $150. As we have assumed, the marginal cost is $125 and does not depend on output, making the marginal cost curve a horizontal line. As noted earlier, we can easily determine the airline’s profit: it is the sum of the areas of the rectangle <em>B</em> and the rectangle <em>S.</em></p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="nl-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p258"><p>The greater the number of prices the monopolist charges, the lower the lowest price—that is, some consumers will pay prices that approach marginal cost.</p></div>

</ol>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p260"><p>With a very large number of different prices, the picture would look like panel (c), a case of perfect price discrimination. Here, consumers least willing to buy the good pay marginal cost, and the entire consumer surplus is extracted as profit.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p261"><p>Both our airline example and the example in <span data-type="link" data-href="asset/ch8/KrugESS4e_fig_8_11.html">Figure 8-11</span> can be used to make another point: a monopolist that can engage in perfect price discrimination doesn’t cause any inefficiency! Because the source of inefficiency is eliminated, all potential consumers who are willing to purchase the good at a price equal to or above marginal cost are able to do so. The perfectly price-discriminating monopolist manages to “scoop up” all consumers by offering some of them lower prices than it charges others.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p262"><p>Perfect price discrimination is almost never possible in practice. At a fundamental level, the inability to achieve perfect price discrimination is a problem of prices as economic signals.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p263"><p>When prices work as economic signals, they convey the information needed to ensure that all mutually beneficial transactions will indeed occur: the market price signals the seller’s cost, and a consumer signals willingness to pay by purchasing the good whenever that willingness to pay is at least as high as the market price.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p264"><p>The problem in reality, however, is that prices are often not perfect signals: a consumer’s true willingness to pay can be disguised, as by a business traveler who claims to be a student when buying a ticket in order to obtain a lower fare. When such disguises work, a monopolist cannot achieve perfect price discrimination.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p265"><p>However, monopolists do try to move in the direction of perfect price discrimination through a variety of pricing strategies. Common techniques for price discrimination include the following:</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bullet" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-list-17">
<li><div data-block_type="bl-first" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p266"><p><em>Advance purchase restrictions.</em> Prices are lower for those who purchase well in advance (or in some cases for those who purchase at the last minute). This separates those who are likely to shop for better prices from those who won’t.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_254"><p>254</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-mid" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p267"><p><em>Volume discounts.</em> Often the price is lower if you buy a large quantity. For a consumer who plans to consume a lot of a good, the cost of the last unit—the marginal cost to the consumer—is considerably less than the average price. This separates those who plan to buy a lot, and so are likely to be more sensitive to price, from those who don’t.</p></div>
</li>
<li><div data-block_type="bl-last" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p268"><p><em>Two-part tariffs.</em> With a two-part tariff, a customer pays a flat fee upfront and then a per-unit fee on each item purchased. So in a discount club like Sam’s Club (which is not a monopolist but a monopolistic competitor), you pay an annual fee in addition to the cost of the items you purchase. So the cost of the first item you buy is in effect much higher than that of subsequent items, making the two-part tariff behave like a volume discount.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="txt-ni" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p269"><p>Our discussion also helps explain why government policies on monopoly typically focus on preventing deadweight losses, not preventing price discrimination—unless it causes serious issues of equity. Compared to a single-price monopolist, price discrimination—even when it is not perfect—can increase the efficiency of the market.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="page_start" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_page_255"><p>255</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p270"><p>If sales to consumers formerly priced out of the market but now able to purchase the good at a lower price generate enough surplus to offset the loss in surplus to those now facing a higher price and no longer buying the good, then total surplus increases when price discrimination is introduced.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p271"><p>An example of this might be a drug that is disproportionately prescribed to senior citizens, who are often on fixed incomes and so are very sensitive to price. A policy that allows a drug company to charge senior citizens a low price and everyone else a high price may indeed increase total surplus compared to a situation in which everyone is charged the same price. But price discrimination that creates serious concerns about equity is likely to be prohibited—for example, an ambulance service that charges patients based on the severity of their emergency.</p></div>

Or why, driving along America’s highways, do you sometimes encounter clusters of outlet stores a few hours away from the nearest city?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p275"><p>These familiar features of the economic landscape are actually peculiar if you think about them: why should sheets and towels be cheaper for a week each winter, or raincoats be offered for less in Freeport, Maine, than in Boston? In each case the answer is that the sellers—who are often oligopolists or monopolistic competitors—are engaged in a subtle form of price discrimination.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p276"><p>Why hold regular sales of sheets and towels? Stores are aware that some consumers buy these goods only when they need them; they are not likely to put a lot of effort into searching for the best price and so have a relatively low price elasticity of demand. The store wants to charge high prices for these customers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p277"><p>But shoppers who plan ahead, looking for the lowest price, will wait for a sale. By scheduling sales only now and then, the store is in effect able to price-discriminate between high-elasticity and low-elasticity customers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p278"><p>An outlet store serves the same purpose: by offering merchandise for low prices, but only at a considerable distance away, a seller is able to establish a separate market for customers who are willing to make the effort to find lower prices—and who therefore have a relatively high price elasticity of demand.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p279"><p>Finally, let’s return to airline tickets to mention one of the truly odd features of their prices. Often a flight from one major destination to another is cheaper than a much shorter flight to a smaller city. Again, the reason is a difference in the price elasticity of demand: customers have a choice of many airlines between major destinations like Chicago and Los Angeles, so the demand for any one flight is quite elastic. Customers have very little choice in flights to a small city, like Chicago to Salt Lake City, so the demand is much less elastic.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p280"><p>But often there is a flight between two major destinations that makes a stop along the way—say, a flight from Chicago to Los Angeles with a stop in Salt Lake City. In these cases, it is sometimes cheaper to fly to the more distant city than to the city that is a stop along the way. For example, it may be cheaper to purchase a ticket to Los Angeles and get off in Salt Lake City than to purchase a ticket to Salt Lake City!

<div data-block_type="bx2-txt" id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch8-p281"><p>So why don’t passengers simply buy a ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles, but get off at Salt Lake City? Well, some do—but the airlines, understandably, make it difficult to find out about such “ghost cities.” Also, they will not allow you to check baggage for only part of a trip if you have a ticket for the final destination. And airlines refuse to honor tickets for return flights if all the legs of the outbound flight have not been completed. All these restrictions are meant to enforce the separation of markets necessary to allow price discrimination.</p></div>
