Hand edits for KrugmanWellsEssentials4e
edit src="images" to src="asset/ch3" (or whatever chapter number)
*** use fix_links.pl *** resolves href="#kaufman... to URLs, either for chapters or figures 
run keyterms scripts
check data-href for numbered tables
many figures need different width and align values
took "abc" off some images files (5 & 10) and adjusted XML accordingly
must edit key terms matching question

Still need to add Show Answers after each list item in the CYU features.

for consistency, ch 2, 4, 5 tables (num and unnum) were numbered from 1..n, with a pool of shared, consecutive numbers
ch 5, first table (unnum) had no data-href

data-block_type edits
bx2-h ---> bx-2-h
bx2-t ---> bx-2-t
bx1-h ---> bx-1-h

check all questions for IDs and block_types
should be consecutive accross both question types, and block types are correct: q_cyu, q_prob

check all href="#...". Many have '-' and '_' confused in different ways.

"Numbered lists" in tables need fixing. Change XML (shown below).

<td class="tbl-ljust">
