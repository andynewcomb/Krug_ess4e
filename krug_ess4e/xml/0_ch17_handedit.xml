<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p12" block_type="co-txt-ni"><phrase block_type="dropcap">O</phrase>N FEBRUARY 27, 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a &#36;787 billion package of spending, aid, and tax cuts intended to help the struggling U.S. economy reverse a severe recession that began in December 2007. A week earlier, as the bill neared final passage in Congress, Obama hailed the measure: &#8220;It is the right size; it is the right scope. Broadly speaking it has the right priorities to create jobs that will jumpstart our economy and transform it for the twenty-first century.&#8221;</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p13" block_type="co-txt">Others weren&#8217;t so sure. Some argued that the government should be cutting spending, not increasing it, at a time when American families were suffering. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for government to tighten their belts and show the American people that we &#8216;get&#8217; it,&#8221; said John Boehner, the leader of Republicans in the House of Representatives at the time. Some economic analysts warned that the stimulus bill, as the Recovery Act was commonly called, would drive up interest rates and increase the burden of national debt.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p14" block_type="co-txt">Others had the opposite complaint&#8212;that the stimulus was too small given the economy&#8217;s troubles. For example, Joseph Stiglitz, the 2001 recipient of the Nobel Prize in economics, stated about the stimulus, &#8220;First of all that it was not enough should be pretty apparent from what I just said: it is trying to offset the deficiency in aggregate demand and it is just too small.&#8221;</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p15" block_type="co-txt">Nor did the passage of time resolve these disputes. True, some predictions were proved false. On one side, Obama&#8217;s hope that the bill would &#8220;jumpstart&#8221; the economy fell short: although the recession officially ended in June 2009, unemployment remained high through 2011 and into 2012, by which time the stimulus had largely run its course. On the other side, the soaring interest rates predicted by stimulus opponents failed to materialize, as U.S. borrowing costs remained low by historical standards. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p16" block_type="co-txt">But the net effect of the stimulus remained controversial, with opponents arguing that it had failed to help the economy and defenders arguing that things would have been much worse without it.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p17" block_type="co-txt">Whatever the verdict&#8212;and this is one of those issues that economists and historians will probably be arguing about for decades to come&#8212;the Recovery Act of 2009 was a classic example of <em>fiscal policy,</em> the use of government spending and taxes to manage aggregate demand.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p18" block_type="co-txt">In this chapter we&#8217;ll see how fiscal policy fits into the models of economic fluctuations we studied in <link href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch16_1.html">Chapter 16</link>. We&#8217;ll also see why budget deficits and government debt can be a problem and how short-run and long-run concerns can pull fiscal policy in different directions.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p19" block_type="txt-ni">Let&#8217;s begin with the obvious: modern governments in economically advanced countries spend a great deal of money and collect a lot in taxes. <link href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_01.html">Figure 17-1</link> shows government spending and tax revenue as percentages of GDP for a selection of high-income countries in 2014. As you can see, the French government sector is relatively large, accounting for more than half of the French economy. The government of the United States plays a smaller role in the economy than those of Canada or most European countries. But that role is still sizable, with the government playing a major role in the U.S. economy. As a result, changes in the federal budget&#8212;changes in government spending or in taxation&#8212;can have large effects on the American economy. </p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p30" block_type="txt">The term <strong>social insurance</strong> is used to describe government programs that are intended to protect families against economic hardship. These include Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as well as smaller programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps. And in 2014, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was implemented. Created to ensure that every American is covered by health insurance, the ACA works through a system of regulated private insurance markets, subsidies, and an expansion of Medicaid eligibility. In the United States, social insurance programs are largely paid for with special, dedicated taxes on wages&#8212;the social insurance taxes we mentioned earlier. (Except for the ACA, which relies mostly on private purchases of health insurance coverage.)</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p31" block_type="txt">But how do tax policy and government spending affect the economy? The answer is that taxation and government spending have a strong effect on total aggregate spending in the economy.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p32" block_type="txt-ni">Let&#8217;s recall the basic equation of national income accounting:</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p33" block_type="eq"><strong>(17-1)</strong> GDP = <em>C</em> &#43; <em>I</em> &#43; <em>G</em> &#43; <em>X</em> &#8722; <em>IM</em></p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p34" block_type="txt">The left side of this equation is GDP, the value of all final goods and services produced in the economy. The right side is aggregate spending, total spending on final goods and services produced in the economy. It is the sum of consumer spending (<em>C</em>), investment spending (<em>I</em>), government purchases of goods and services (<em>G</em>), and the value of exports (<em>X</em>) minus the value of imports (<em>IM</em>). It includes all the sources of aggregate demand.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p35" block_type="txt">The government directly controls one of the variables on the right side of <link href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p33">Equation 17-1</link>: government purchases of goods and services (<em>G</em>). But that&#8217;s not the only effect fiscal policy has on aggregate spending in the economy. Through changes in taxes and transfers, it also influences consumer spending (<em>C</em>) and, in some cases, investment spending (<em>I</em>).</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch17_page_478" block_type="page_start">478</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p36" block_type="txt">To see why the budget affects consumer spending, recall that <em>disposable income,</em> the total income households have available to spend, is equal to the total income they receive from wages, dividends, interest, and rent, <em>minus</em> taxes, <em>plus</em> government transfers. So either an increase in taxes or a reduction in government transfers <em>reduces</em> disposable income. And a fall in disposable income, other things equal, leads to a fall in consumer spending. Conversely, either a decrease in taxes or an increase in government transfers <em>increases</em> disposable income. And a rise in disposable income, other things equal, leads to a rise in consumer spending.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p37" block_type="txt">The government&#8217;s ability to affect investment spending is a more complex story, which we won&#8217;t discuss in detail. The important point is that the government taxes profits, and changes in the rules that determine how much a business owes can increase or reduce the incentive to spend on investment goods.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p38" block_type="txt">Because the government itself is one source of spending in the economy, and because taxes and transfers can affect spending by consumers and firms, the government can use changes in taxes or government spending to <em>shift the aggregate demand curve.</em> And as we saw in <link href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch16_1.html">Chapter 16</link>, there are sometimes good reasons to shift the aggregate demand curve.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p39" block_type="txt">In early 2009, as this chapter&#8217;s opening story explained, the Obama administration believed it was crucial that the U.S. government act to increase aggregate demand&#8212;that is, to move the aggregate demand curve to the right of where it would otherwise be. The 2009 stimulus package was a classic example of <em>fiscal policy:</em> the use of taxes, government transfers, or government purchases of goods and services to stabilize the economy by shifting the aggregate demand curve.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p53" block_type="txt-ni">In practice, the use of fiscal policy&#8212;in particular, the use of expansionary fiscal policy in the face of a recessionary gap&#8212;is often controversial. Let&#8217;s quickly summarize the major points of the debate over expansionary fiscal policy, so we can understand when the critiques are justified and when they are not.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p54" block_type="txt">Broadly speaking, there are three arguments against the use of expansionary fiscal policy.</p>
<list id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-list-5" type="ordered" block_type="numbered">
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p55" block_type="nl-first">Government spending always crowds out private spending</p></li>
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p56" block_type="nl-mid">Government borrowing always crowds out private investment spending</p></li>
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p57" block_type="nl-last">Government budget deficits lead to reduced private spending</p></li>
</list>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p58" block_type="txt">The first of these claims is wrong in principle, but it has nonetheless played a prominent role in public debates. The second is valid under some, but not all, circumstances. The third argument, although it raises some important issues, isn&#8217;t a good reason to believe that expansionary fiscal policy doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p59" block_type="txt-3"><phrase block_type="h3"><strong>Claim 1: &#8220;Government Spending Always Crowds Out Private Spending&#8221;</strong></phrase> Some claim that expansionary fiscal policy can never raise aggregate spending and therefore can never raise aggregate income, with reasons that go something like this: &#8220;Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken away from the private sector. So any rise in government spending must be offset by an equal fall in private spending.&#8221; In other words, every dollar spent by the government <em>crowds out,</em> or displaces, a dollar of private spending.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p60" block_type="txt">What&#8217;s wrong with this view? The answer is that it assumes that resources in the economy are always fully employed and, as a result, the aggregate income earned in the economy is always a fixed sum&#8212;which isn&#8217;t true. In reality, whether or not government spending crowds out private spending depends upon the state of the economy. In particular, when the economy is suffering from a recessionary gap, there are unemployed resources in the economy and output, and therefore income, is below its potential level. Expansionary fiscal policy during these periods puts unemployed resources to work and generates higher spending and higher income. Government spending crowds out private spending only when the economy is operating at full employment. So the argument that expansionary fiscal policy always crowds out private spending is wrong in principle.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p61" block_type="txt-3"><phrase block_type="h3"><strong>Claim 2: &#8220;Government Borrowing Always Crowds Out Private Investment Spending&#8221;</strong></phrase> How valid is the argument that government borrowing uses funds that would have otherwise been used for private investment spending&#8212;that is, it crowds out private investment spending?</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p62" block_type="txt">The answer is that &#8220;it depends.&#8221; Specifically, it depends on whether the economy is depressed or not. If the economy is not depressed, then increased government borrowing, by increasing the demand for loanable funds, can raise interest rates and crowd out private investment spending. However, what if the economy is depressed? In that case, crowding out is much less likely. When the economy is at far less than full employment, a fiscal expansion will lead to higher incomes, which in turn leads to increased savings at any given interest rate. This larger pool of savings allows the government to borrow without driving up interest rates. The Recovery Act of 2009 was a case in point: despite high levels of government borrowing, U.S. interest rates stayed near historic lows.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p63" block_type="txt-3"><phrase block_type="h3"><strong>Claim 3: &#8220;Government Budget Deficits Lead to Reduced Private Spending&#8221;</strong></phrase> Other things equal, expansionary fiscal policy leads to a larger budget deficit and greater government debt. And higher debt will eventually require the government to raise taxes to pay it off. So, according to the third argument against expansionary fiscal policy, consumers, anticipating that they must pay higher taxes in the future to pay off today&#8217;s government debt, will cut their spending today in order to save money. This argument, first made by nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo, is known as <em>Ricardian equivalence</em>. It is an argument often taken to imply that expansionary fiscal policy will have no effect on the economy because far-sighted consumers will undo any attempts at expansion by the government. (And will also undo any contractionary fiscal policy, for that matter.)</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p64" block_type="txt">In reality, however, it&#8217;s doubtful that consumers behave with such foresight and budgeting discipline. Most people, when provided with extra cash (generated by the fiscal expansion), will spend at least some of it. So even fiscal policy that takes the form of temporary tax cuts or transfers of cash to consumers probably does have an expansionary effect.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p65" block_type="txt">Moreover, it&#8217;s possible to show that even with Ricardian equivalence, a temporary rise in government spending that involves direct purchases of goods and services&#8212;such as a program of road construction&#8212;would still lead to a boost in total spending in the near term. That&#8217;s because even if consumers cut back their current spending in anticipation of higher future taxes, their reduced spending will take place over an extended period as consumers save over time to pay the future tax bill. Meanwhile, the additional government spending will be concentrated in the near future, when the economy needs it.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p66" block_type="txt">So although the effects emphasized by Ricardian equivalence may reduce the impact of fiscal expansion, the claim that it makes fiscal expansion completely ineffective is neither consistent with how consumers actually behave nor a reason to believe that increases in government spending have no effect. So, in the end, it&#8217;s not a valid argument against expansionary fiscal policy. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p67" block_type="txt">In sum, then, the extent to which we should expect expansionary fiscal policy to work depends upon the circumstances. When the economy has a recessionary gap&#8212;as it did when the 2009 Recovery Act was passed&#8212;economics tells us that this is just the kind of situation in which expansionary fiscal policy helps the economy. However, when the economy is already at full employment, expansionary fiscal policy is the wrong policy and will lead to crowding out, an overheated economy, and higher inflation.</p>

<section-metadata><section-title>A Cautionary Note: Lags in Fiscal Policy</section-title></section-metadata>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p68" block_type="txt-ni">Looking back at <link href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-fig-5">Figures 17-4</link> and <link href="#krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-fig-6">17-5</link>, it may seem obvious that the government should actively use fiscal policy&#8212;always adopting an expansionary fiscal policy when the economy faces a recessionary gap and always adopting a contractionary fiscal policy when the economy faces an inflationary gap. But many economists caution against an extremely active stabilization policy, arguing that a government that tries too hard to stabilize the economy&#8212;through either fiscal policy or monetary policy&#8212;can end up making the economy less stable.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch17_page_482" block_type="page_start">482</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p69" block_type="txt">We&#8217;ll leave discussion of the warnings associated with monetary policy to <link href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch19_1.html">Chapter 19</link>. In the case of fiscal policy, one key reason for caution is that there are important <em>time lags</em> between when the policy is decided upon and when it is implemented. To understand the nature of these lags, think about what has to happen before the government increases spending to fight a recessionary gap. First, the government has to realize that the recessionary gap exists: economic data take time to collect and analyze, and recessions are often recognized only months after they have begun. Second, the government has to develop a spending plan, which can itself take months, particularly if politicians take time debating how the money should be spent and passing legislation. Finally, it takes time to spend money. For example, a road construction project begins with activities such as surveying that don&#8217;t involve spending large sums. It may be quite some time before the big spending begins.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p70" block_type="txt">Because of these lags, an attempt to increase spending to fight a recessionary gap may take so long to get going that the economy has already recovered on its own. In fact, the recessionary gap may have turned into an inflationary gap by the time the fiscal policy takes effect. In that case, the fiscal policy will make things worse instead of better.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p71" block_type="txt">This doesn&#8217;t mean that fiscal policy should never be actively used. In early 2009 there was good reason to believe that the slump facing the U.S. economy would be both deep and long and that a fiscal stimulus designed to arrive over the next year or two would almost surely push aggregate demand in the right direction. In fact, as we&#8217;ll soon see the 2009 stimulus arguably faded out too soon, leaving the economy still deeply depressed. But the problem of lags makes the actual use of both fiscal and monetary policy harder than you might think from a simple analysis like the one we have just given.</p>

Here, the numbers are broken down into <em>four</em> categories, not three. &#8220;Infrastructure and other spending&#8221; means spending on roads, bridges, and schools as well as &#8220;nontraditional&#8221; infrastructure like research and development, all of which fall under government purchases of goods and services. &#8220;Tax cuts&#8221; are self-explanatory. &#8220;Transfer payments to persons&#8221; mostly took the form of expanded benefits for the unemployed. But a fourth category, &#8220;transfers to state and local governments,&#8221; accounted for roughly a third of the funds. Why this fourth category? </p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p90" block_type="txt-ni">An expansionary fiscal policy, like the 2009 U.S. stimulus, pushes the aggregate demand curve to the right. A contractionary fiscal policy, like Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s tax surcharge, pushes the aggregate demand curve to the left. For policy makers, however, knowing the direction of the shift isn&#8217;t enough: they need estimates of <em>how much</em> a given policy will shift the aggregate demand curve.

To answer this question, we need to introduce the concept of the <strong>marginal propensity to consume,</strong> or <strong><em>MPC:</em></strong> the increase in consumer spending when disposable income rises by &#36;1.

Also assume that the aggregate price level is fixed, so that any increase in nominal GDP is also a rise in real GDP, and assume that the interest rate is fixed. In this case, the multiplier is 1/(1 &#8722; <em>MPC</em>). So, if the marginal propensity to consume is 0.5, the multiplier is 1/(1 &#8722; 0.5) = 1/0.5 = 2. Given a multiplier of 2, a &#36;50 billion increase in government purchases of goods and services would increase real GDP by &#36;100 billion.

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p102" block_type="txt">However, the first-round effect of the transfer program is smaller; because we have assumed that the <em>MPC</em> is 0.5, only &#36;25 billion of the &#36;50 billion is spent, with the other &#36;25 billion saved. And as a result, all the further rounds are smaller, too. In the end, the transfer payment increases real GDP by only &#36;50 billion. In comparison, a &#36;50 billion increase in government purchases produces a &#36;100 billion increase in real GDP.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p103" block_type="txt">Overall, when expansionary fiscal policy takes the form of a rise in transfer payments, real GDP may rise by either more or less than the initial government outlay&#8212;that is, the multiplier may be either more or less than 1 depending upon the size of the <em>MPC.</em> In <link href="asset/ch14/table_14_1.html">Table 17-1</link>, with an <em>MPC</em> equal to 0.5, the multiplier is exactly 1: a &#36;50 billion rise in transfer payments increases real GDP by &#36;50 billion. If the <em>MPC</em> is less than 0.5, so that a smaller share of the initial transfer is spent, the multiplier on that transfer is <em>less</em> than 1. If a larger share of the initial transfer is spent, the multiplier is <em>more</em> than 1.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p104" block_type="txt">A tax cut has an effect similar to the effect of a transfer. It increases disposable income, leading to a series of increases in consumer spending. But the overall effect is smaller than that of an equal-sized increase in government purchases of goods and services: the autonomous increase in aggregate spending is smaller because households save part of the amount of the tax cut.</p>

</box>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p106" block_type="txt">We should also note that taxes introduce a further complication&#8212;they typically change the size of the multiplier. That&#8217;s because in the real world governments rarely impose <strong>lump-sum taxes,</strong> in which the amount of tax a household owes is independent of its income. With lump-sum taxes there is no change in the multiplier. Instead, the great majority of tax revenue is raised via taxes that are not lump-sum, and so tax revenue depends upon the level of real GDP.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p107" block_type="txt">In practice, economists often argue that the size of the multiplier determines <em>who</em> among the population should get tax cuts or increases in government transfers. For example, compare the effects of an increase in unemployment benefits with a cut in taxes on profits distributed to shareholders as dividends. Consumer surveys suggest that the average unemployed worker will spend a higher share of any increase in his or her disposable income than would the average recipient of dividend income. That is, people who are unemployed tend to have a higher <em>MPC</em> than people who own a lot of stocks because the latter tend to be wealthier and tend to save more of any increase in disposable income. If that&#8217;s true, a dollar spent on unemployment benefits increases aggregate demand more than a dollar&#8217;s worth of dividend tax cuts.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p108" block_type="txt-ni">The increase in government tax revenue when real GDP rises isn&#8217;t the result of a deliberate decision or action by the government. It&#8217;s a consequence of the way the tax laws are written, which causes most sources of government revenue to increase <em>automatically</em> when real GDP goes up. For example, income tax receipts increase when real GDP rises because the amount each individual owes in taxes depends positively on his or her income, and households&#8217; taxable income rises when real GDP rises. Sales tax receipts increase when real GDP rises because people with more income spend more on goods and services. And corporate profit tax receipts increase when real GDP rises because profits increase when the economy expands.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p109" block_type="txt">The effect of these automatic increases in tax revenue is to reduce the size of the multiplier. Remember, the multiplier is the result of a chain reaction in which higher real GDP leads to higher disposable income, which leads to higher consumer spending, which leads to further increases in real GDP. The fact that the government siphons off some of any increase in real GDP means that at each stage of this process, the increase in consumer spending is smaller than it would be if taxes weren&#8217;t part of the picture. The result is to reduce the multiplier.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p110" block_type="txt">Many macroeconomists believe it&#8217;s a good thing that in real life taxes reduce the multiplier. In <link href="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch16_1.html">Chapter 16</link> we argued that most, though not all, recessions are the result of negative demand shocks. The same mechanism that causes tax revenue to increase when the economy expands causes it to decrease when the economy contracts. Since tax receipts decrease when real GDP falls, the effects of these negative demand shocks are smaller than they would be if there were no taxes. The decrease in tax revenue reduces the adverse effect of the initial fall in aggregate demand.</p>

</box>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p112" block_type="txt">The automatic decrease in government tax revenue generated by a fall in real GDP&#8212;caused by a decrease in the amount of taxes households pay&#8212;acts like an automatic expansionary fiscal policy implemented in the face of a recession. Similarly, when the economy expands, the government finds itself automatically pursuing a contractionary fiscal policy&#8212;a tax increase. Government spending and taxation rules that cause fiscal policy to be automatically expansionary when the economy contracts and automatically contractionary when the economy expands, without requiring any deliberate action by policy makers, are called <strong>automatic stabilizers.</strong></p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p113" block_type="txt">The rules that govern tax collection aren&#8217;t the only automatic stabilizers, although they are the most important ones. Some types of government transfers also play a stabilizing role. For example, more people receive unemployment insurance when the economy is depressed than when it is booming. The same is true of Medicaid and food stamps. So transfer payments tend to rise when the economy is contracting and fall when the economy is expanding. Like changes in tax revenue, these automatic changes in transfers tend to reduce the size of the multiplier because the total change in disposable income that results from a given rise or fall in real GDP is smaller.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p114" block_type="txt">As in the case of government tax revenue, many macroeconomists believe that it&#8217;s a good thing that government transfers reduce the multiplier. Expansionary and contractionary fiscal policies that are the result of automatic stabilizers are widely considered helpful to macroeconomic stabilization because they blunt the extremes of the business cycle.</p>

Until a few years ago, the answer would have been that we didn&#8217;t have nearly as much evidence as we&#8217;d like. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p120" block_type="bx2-txt">The problem was that large changes in fiscal policy are fairly rare, and usually happen at the same time other things are taking place, making it hard to separate the effects of spending and taxes from those of other factors. For example, the U.S. drastically increased spending during World War II&#8212;but it also instituted rationing of many consumer goods, more or less banned construction of new houses, and so on. So the effects of the spending increase are hard to distinguish from the overall conversion from a peacetime to a war economy.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p121" block_type="bx2-txt">Recent events have, however, offered considerable new evidence. After 2009 several European countries found themselves facing debt crises, so they were forced to turn to the rest of Europe for aid. A condition of this aid was <em>austerity</em>&#8212;sharp cuts in spending plus tax increases. By comparing the economic performance of countries that were forced into austerity with that of countries that weren&#8217;t, we get a relatively clear view of the effects of changes in spending and taxes.</p>

Greece&#8212;which was forced to impose severe spending cuts, and suffered a huge fall in output&#8212;stands out, but even without Greece there is a clear negative relationship. A line fitted through the scatterplot has a slope of &#8722;1.6.

People usually think of surpluses as good: when the federal government ran a record surplus in 2000, many people regarded it as a cause for celebration. Conversely, people usually think of deficits as bad: when the U.S. federal government ran record deficits in 2009 and 2010, many people regarded it as a cause for concern.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p134" block_type="txt-ni">What do we mean by surpluses and deficits? The budget balance is the difference between the government&#8217;s revenue, in the form of tax revenue, and its spending, both on goods and services and on government transfers, in a given year. That is, the budget balance&#8212;savings by government&#8212;is defined by <link href="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p135">Equation 17-3</link>:</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p135" block_type="eq"><strong>(17-3)</strong> <em>S<sub>Government</sub></em> = <em>T</em> &#8722; <em>G</em> &#8722; <em>TR</em></p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p136" block_type="txt-ni">where <em>T</em> is the value of tax revenues, <em>G</em> is government purchases of goods and services, and <em>TR</em> is the value of government transfers. A budget surplus is a positive budget balance and a budget deficit is a negative budget balance.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p137" block_type="txt">Other things equal, expansionary fiscal policies&#8212;increased government purchases of goods and services, higher government transfers, or lower taxes&#8212;reduce the budget balance for that year. That is, expansionary fiscal policies make a budget surplus smaller or a budget deficit bigger. Conversely, contractionary fiscal policies&#8212;reduced government purchases of goods and services, lower government transfers, or higher taxes&#8212;increase the budget balance for that year, making a budget surplus bigger or a budget deficit smaller.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p138" block_type="txt">You might think this means that changes in the budget balance can be used to measure fiscal policy. In fact, economists often do just that: they use changes in the budget balance as a &#8220;quick-and-dirty&#8221; way to assess whether current fiscal policy is expansionary or contractionary. But they always keep in mind two reasons this quick-and-dirty approach is sometimes misleading:</p>

Shaded areas indicate recessions; unshaded areas indicate expansions. As you can see, the federal budget deficit increased around the time of each recession and usually declined during expansions. In fact, in the late stages of the long expansion from 1991 to 2000, the deficit actually became negative&#8212;the budget deficit became a budget surplus.</p>

<caption>There is a close relationship between the budget balance and the business cycle: a recession moves the budget balance toward deficit, but an expansion moves it toward surplus.

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p144" block_type="txt">Is this relationship between the business cycle and the budget balance evidence that policy makers engage in discretionary fiscal policy, using expansionary fiscal policy during recessions and contractionary fiscal policy during expansions? Not necessarily. To a large extent the relationship in <link href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_09.html">Figure 17-9</link> reflects automatic stabilizers at work. As we saw earlier in the discussion of automatic stabilizers, government tax revenue tends to rise and some government transfers, like unemployment benefit payments, tend to fall when the economy expands. Conversely, government tax revenue tends to fall and some government transfers tend to rise when the economy contracts. So the budget tends to move toward surplus during expansions and toward deficit during recessions even without any deliberate action on the part of policy makers.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p145" block_type="txt">In assessing budget policy, it&#8217;s often useful to separate movements in the budget balance due to the business cycle from movements due to discretionary fiscal policy changes. The former are affected by automatic stabilizers and the latter by deliberate changes in government purchases, government transfers, or taxes. It&#8217;s important to realize that business-cycle effects on the budget balance are temporary: both recessionary gaps (in which real GDP is below potential output) and inflationary gaps (in which real GDP is above potential output) tend to be eliminated in the long run. Removing their effects on the budget balance sheds light on whether the government&#8217;s taxing and spending policies are sustainable in the long run. </p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p148" block_type="txt">To separate the effect of the business cycle from the effects of other factors, many governments produce an estimate of what the budget balance would be if there were neither a recessionary nor an inflationary gap. The <strong>cyclically adjusted budget balance</strong> is an estimate of what the budget balance would be if real GDP were exactly equal to potential output. It takes into account the extra tax revenue the government would collect and the transfers it would save if a recessionary gap were eliminated&#8212;or the revenue the government would lose and the extra transfers it would make if an inflationary gap were eliminated.</p>

As you can see, the cyclically adjusted budget deficit doesn&#8217;t fluctuate as much as the actual budget deficit. In particular, large actual deficits, such as those of 1975, 1983, and 2009, are usually caused in part by a depressed economy. </p>

<section-metadata><section-title>Should the Budget Be Balanced?</section-title></section-metadata>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p150" block_type="txt-ni">As we&#8217;ll see in the next section, persistent budget deficits can cause problems for both the government and the economy. Yet politicians are always tempted to run deficits because this allows them to cater to voters by cutting taxes without cutting spending or by increasing spending without increasing taxes. As a result, there are occasional attempts by policy makers to force fiscal discipline by introducing legislation&#8212;even a constitutional amendment&#8212;forbidding the government from running budget deficits. This is usually stated as a requirement that the budget be &#8220;balanced&#8221;&#8212;that revenues at least equal spending each fiscal year. Would it be a good idea to require a balanced budget annually?</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch17_page_491" block_type="page_start">491</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p151" block_type="txt">Most economists don&#8217;t think so. They believe that the government should only balance its budget on average&#8212;that it should be allowed to run deficits in bad years, offset by surpluses in good years. They don&#8217;t believe the government should be forced to run a balanced budget <em>every year</em> because this would undermine the role of taxes and transfers as automatic stabilizers. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p152" block_type="txt">As we learned earlier, the tendency of tax revenue to fall and transfers to rise when the economy contracts helps to limit the size of recessions. But falling tax revenue and rising transfer payments generated by a downturn in the economy push the budget toward deficit. If constrained by a balanced-budget rule, the government would have to respond to this deficit with contractionary fiscal policies that would tend to deepen a recession.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p153" block_type="txt">Yet policy makers concerned about excessive deficits sometimes feel that rigid rules prohibiting&#8212;or at least setting an upper limit on&#8212;deficits are necessary. As the following Economics in Action explains, Europe has had a lot of trouble reconciling rules to enforce fiscal responsibility with the challenges of short-run fiscal policy.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p156" block_type="bx2-first"><phrase block_type="dropcap">I</phrase>n 1999 a group of European nations took a momentous step when they adopted a common currency, the euro, to replace their various national currencies, such as the French franc, the German mark, and the Italian lira. Along with the introduction of the euro came the creation of the European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the whole region.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p157" block_type="bx2-txt">As part of the agreement creating the new currency, governments of member countries signed on to the European &#8220;stability pact.&#8221; This agreement required each government to keep its budget deficit&#8212;its actual deficit, not a cyclically adjusted number&#8212;below 3&#37; of the country&#8217;s GDP or face fines. The pact was intended to prevent irresponsible deficit spending arising from political pressure that might eventually undermine the new currency.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p158" block_type="bx2-txt">The stability pact, however, had a serious downside: in principle, it would force countries to slash spending and/or raise taxes whenever an economic downturn pushed their deficits above the critical level. This would turn fiscal policy into a force that worsens recessions instead of fighting them.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p159" block_type="bx2-txt">Nonetheless, the stability pact proved impossible to enforce: European nations, including France and even Germany, with its reputation for fiscal probity, simply ignored the rule during the 2001 recession and its aftermath.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p160" block_type="bx2-txt">In 2011 the Europeans tried again, this time against the background of a severe debt crisis. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy all lost the confidence of investors, who were worried about their ability and/or willingness to repay all their debt&#8212;and the efforts of these nations to reduce their deficits seemed likely to push Europe back into recession. Yet a return to the old stability pact didn&#8217;t seem to make sense. Among other things, it was clear that the stability pact&#8217;s rule on the size of budget deficits would not have done much to prevent the crisis&#8212;in 2007 all of the problem debtors except Greece were running deficits under 3&#37; of GDP, with Ireland and Spain actually running surpluses.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p161" block_type="bx2-txt">So the agreement reached in December 2011 was framed in terms of the &#8220;structural&#8221; budget balance, more or less corresponding to the cyclically adjusted budget balance as we defined it. According to the new rule, the structural budget balance of each country should be very nearly zero, with deficits not to exceed 0.5&#37; of GDP. This seemed like a much better rule than the old stability pact.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch17_page_492" block_type="page_start">492</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p162" block_type="bx2-txt">Yet big problems remained. One was the question of how reliable were the estimates of the structural budget balances. Also, the new rule seemed to ban any use of discretionary fiscal policy, under any circumstances. By early 2015 it was clear that this fiscal straight-jacket was a problem: a weakening European economy clearly needed stimulus but the fiscal rule prohibited it.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p163" block_type="bx2-txt">Before patting themselves on the back over the superiority of their own fiscal rules, Americans should note that the United States has its own version of the original, flawed European stability pact. The federal government&#8217;s budget acts as an automatic stabilizer, but 49 of the 50 states are required by their state constitutions to balance their budgets every year. When recession struck in 2008, most states were forced to&#8212;guess what?&#8212;slash spending and raise taxes in the face of a recession, exactly the wrong thing from a macroeconomic point of view.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p170" block_type="txt-ni">In 2009 the government of Greece ran into a financial wall. Like most other governments in Europe (and the U.S. government, too), the Greek government was running a large budget deficit, which meant that it needed to keep borrowing more funds, both to cover its expenses and to pay off existing loans as they came due. But governments, like companies or individuals, can only borrow if lenders believe there&#8217;s a good chance they are willing or able to repay their debts. By 2009 most investors, having lost confidence in Greece&#8217;s financial future, were no longer willing to lend to the Greek government. Those few who were willing to lend demanded very high interest rates to compensate them for the risk of loss.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p171" block_type="txt"><link href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_11.html">Figure 17-11</link> compares interest rates on 10-year bonds issued by the governments of Greece and Germany. At the beginning of 2007, Greece could borrow at almost the same rate as Germany, widely considered a very safe borrower. By the end of 2011, however, Greece had to pay an interest rate around 10 times the rate Germany paid.</p>

<caption>As late as 2008, the government of Greece could borrow at interest rates only slightly higher than those facing Germany, widely considered a very safe borrower.

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p172" block_type="txt">Why was Greece having these problems? Largely because investors had become deeply worried about the level of its debt (in part because it became clear that the Greek government had been using creative accounting to hide just how much debt it had already taken on). Government debt is, after all, a promise to make future payments to lenders. By 2009 it seemed likely that the Greek government had already promised more than it could possibly deliver.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p173" block_type="txt">The result was that Greece found itself unable to borrow more from private lenders; it received emergency loans from other European nations and the International Monetary Fund, but these loans came with the requirement that the Greek government make severe spending cuts, which wreaked havoc with its economy, imposed severe economic hardship on Greeks, and led to massive social unrest.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p174" block_type="txt">The good news is that by mid-2014 Greek borrowing costs had fallen sharply. In part this reflected a growing sense that Greece would stay the course on spending despite the huge suffering. It also, however, reflected the intervention of the European Central Bank, which assured investors that it would do &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; to sustain the euro, Europe&#8217;s common currency; this move was widely interpreted as a guarantee that, if necessary, it would step in to buy the bonds of Greece and other troubled debtors. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p175" block_type="txt">Despite this good news, however, the crisis in Greece and elsewhere made it clear that no discussion of fiscal policy is complete without taking into account the long-run implications of government budget surpluses and deficits, especially the implications for government debt. We now turn to those long-run implications.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p176" block_type="txt-ni">When a family spends more than it earns over the course of a year, it has to raise the extra funds either by selling assets or by borrowing. And if a family borrows year after year, it will eventually end up with a lot of debt.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p177" block_type="txt">The same is true for governments. With a few exceptions, governments don&#8217;t raise large sums by selling assets such as national parkland. Instead, when a government spends more than the tax revenue it receives&#8212;when it runs a budget deficit&#8212;it almost always borrows the extra funds. And governments that run persistent budget deficits end up with substantial debts.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p179" block_type="txt">To interpret the numbers that follow, you need to know a slightly peculiar feature of federal government accounting. For historical reasons, the U.S. government does not keep books by calendar years. Instead, budget totals are kept by <strong>fiscal years,</strong> which run from October 1 to September 30 and are labeled by the calendar year in which they end. For example, fiscal 2014 began on October 1, 2013, and ended on September 30, 2014.</p>

We&#8217;ll explain those rules shortly. For now, however, let&#8217;s focus on <strong>public debt:</strong> government debt held by individuals and institutions outside the government. At the end of fiscal 2014, the federal government&#8217;s public debt was &#8220;only&#8221; &#36;13.0 trillion, or 74&#37; of GDP. Federal public debt at the end of 2014 was larger than at the end of 2013 because the government ran a deficit in 2014: a government that runs persistent budget deficits will experience a rising level of public debt.

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p182" block_type="bx1-t"><strong>DEFICITS VERSUS DEBT</strong></p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p183" block_type="bx1-txt-ni">One common mistake&#8212;it happens all the time in newspaper reports&#8212;is to confuse <em>deficits</em> with <em>debt.</em> Let&#8217;s review the difference.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p184" block_type="bx1-txt">A <em>deficit</em> is the difference between the amount of money a government spends and the amount it receives in taxes over a given period&#8212;usually, though not always, a year. Deficit numbers always come with a statement about the time period to which they apply, as in &#8220;the U.S. budget deficit <em>in fiscal 2011</em> was &#36;1.3 trillion.&#8221;</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p185" block_type="bx1-txt">A <em>debt</em> is the sum of money a government owes at a particular point in time. Debt numbers usually come with a specific date, as in &#8220;U.S. public debt <em>at the end of fiscal 2011</em> was &#36;10.1 trillion.&#8221;</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p186" block_type="bx1-txt">Deficits and debt are linked, because government debt grows when governments run deficits. But they aren&#8217;t the same thing, and they can even tell different stories. For example, Italy, which found itself in debt trouble in 2011, had a fairly small deficit by historical standards, but it had very high debt, a legacy of past policies.</p>

In dollar terms, we&#8217;re number one&#8212;but this isn&#8217;t very informative, since the U.S. economy and so the government&#8217;s tax base are much larger than those of any other nation. A more informative comparison is the ratio of public debt to GDP.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p189" block_type="bx4-txt">The figure shows the <em>net public debt</em> of a number of rich countries as a percentage of GDP at the end of 2014. Net public debt is government debt minus any assets governments may have&#8212;an adjustment that can make a big difference. What you see here is that the United States is more or less in the middle of the pack.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p190" block_type="bx4-txt">It may not surprise you that Greece heads the list, and most of the other high net debt countries are European nations that have made headlines for their debt problems. Interestingly, however, Japan is also high on the list because it used massive public spending to prop up its economy in the 1990s. Investors, however, still consider Japan a reliable government, so its borrowing costs remain low despite high net debt.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p191" block_type="bx4-txt">In contrast to the other countries, Norway has a large <em>negative</em> net public debt. What&#8217;s going on in Norway? In a word, oil. Norway is the world&#8217;s third-largest oil exporter, thanks to large offshore deposits in the North Sea. Instead of spending its oil revenues immediately, the government of Norway has used them to build up an investment fund for future needs following the lead of traditional oil producers like Saudi Arabia. As a result, Norway has a huge stock of government assets rather than a large government debt.</p>

<section-metadata><section-title>Problems Posed by Rising Government Debt</section-title></section-metadata>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p193" block_type="txt-ni">There are two reasons to be concerned when a government runs persistent budget deficits: first, when the economy is at full employment and the government borrows funds in the financial markets, it is competing with firms that plan to borrow funds for investment spending. As a result, the government&#8217;s borrowing may crowd out private investment spending, increasing interest rates and reducing the economy&#8217;s long-run rate of growth. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p194" block_type="txt">But there&#8217;s a second reason: today&#8217;s deficits, by increasing the government&#8217;s debt, place financial pressure on future budgets. The impact of current deficits on future budgets is straightforward. Like individuals, governments must pay their bills, including interest payments on their accumulated debt. When a government is deeply in debt, those interest payments can be substantial. In fiscal 2014, the U.S. federal government paid 1.3&#37; of GDP&#8212;&#36;221 billion&#8212;in interest on its debt. The more heavily indebted government of Italy paid interest of 5&#37; of its GDP in 2014.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p195" block_type="txt">Other things equal, a government paying large sums in interest must raise more revenue from taxes or spend less than it would otherwise be able to afford&#8212;or it must borrow even more to cover the gap. And a government that borrows to pay interest on its outstanding debt pushes itself even deeper into debt. This process can eventually push a government to the point where lenders question its ability to repay. Like a consumer who has maxed out his or her credit cards, it will find that lenders are unwilling to lend any more funds. The result can be that the government defaults on its debt&#8212;it stops paying what it owes. Default is often followed by deep financial and economic turmoil.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch17_page_495" block_type="page_start">495</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p196" block_type="txt">Americans aren&#8217;t used to the idea of government default, but such things do happen. In the 1990s Argentina, a relatively high-income developing country, was widely praised for its economic policies&#8212;and it was able to borrow large sums from foreign lenders. By 2001, however, Argentina&#8217;s interest payments were spiraling out of control, and the country stopped paying the sums that were due. In the end, it reached a settlement with most of its lenders under which it paid less than a third of the amount originally due. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p197" block_type="txt">In 2010&#8211;2013 investors placed a fairly high probability on Argentine-type default by several European countries&#8212;namely, Greece, Ireland, and Portugal&#8212;and were seriously worried about Italy and Spain. Each one was forced to pay high interest rates on its debt by nervous lenders, exacerbating the risk of default.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p198" block_type="txt">Default creates havoc in a country&#8217;s financial markets and badly shakes public confidence in both the government and the economy. Argentina&#8217;s debt default was accompanied by a crisis in the country&#8217;s banking system and a very severe recession. And even if a highly indebted government avoids default, a heavy debt burden typically forces it to slash spending or raise taxes, politically unpopular measures that can also damage the economy. In some cases, austerity measures intended to reassure lenders that the government can indeed pay end up depressing the economy so much that lender confidence continues to fall.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p199" block_type="txt">Some may ask: why can&#8217;t a government that has trouble borrowing just print money to pay its bills? Yes, it can if it has its own currency (which the troubled European nations don&#8217;t). But printing money to pay the government&#8217;s bills can lead to another problem: inflation. In fact, budget problems are the main cause of very severe inflation. Governments do not want to find themselves in a position where the choice is between defaulting on their debts and inflating those debts away by printing money.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p200" block_type="txt">Concerns about the long-run effects of deficits need not rule out the use of expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate the economy when it is depressed. However, these concerns do mean that governments should try to offset budget deficits in bad years with budget surpluses in good years. In other words, governments should run a budget that is approximately balanced over time. Have they actually done so?</p>

Panel (a) shows the federal deficit as a percentage of GDP. As you can see, the federal government ran huge deficits during World War II. It briefly ran surpluses after the war, but it has normally run deficits ever since, especially after 1980. This seems inconsistent with the advice that governments should offset deficits in bad times with surpluses in good times.</p>

</box>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p203" block_type="txt">However, panel (b) of <link href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_12.html">Figure 17-12</link> shows that for most of the period these persistent deficits didn&#8217;t lead to runaway debt. To assess the ability of governments to pay their debt, we use the <strong>debt&#8211;GDP ratio,</strong> the government&#8217;s debt as a percentage of GDP. We use this measure, rather than simply looking at the size of the debt, because GDP, which measures the size of the economy as a whole, is a good indicator of the potential taxes the government can collect. If the government&#8217;s debt grows more slowly than GDP, the burden of paying that debt is actually falling compared with the government&#8217;s potential tax revenue.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p204" block_type="txt">What we see from panel (b) is that although the federal debt grew in almost every year, the debt&#8211;GDP ratio fell for 30 years after the end of World War II. This shows that the debt&#8211;GDP ratio can fall, even when debt is rising, as long as GDP grows faster than debt. The upcoming For Inquiring Minds, which focuses on the large debt the U.S. government ran up during World War II, explains how growth and inflation sometimes allow a government that runs persistent budget deficits to nevertheless have a declining debt&#8211;GDP ratio.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p205" block_type="txt">Still, a government that runs persistent <em>large</em> deficits will have a rising debt&#8211;GDP ratio when debt grows faster than GDP. In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, the U.S. government began running deficits much larger than anything seen since World War II, and the debt&#8211;GDP ratio began rising sharply. Similar surges in the debt&#8211;GDP ratio could be seen in a number of other countries in 2008. Economists and policy makers agreed that this was not a sustainable trend, that governments would need to get their spending and revenues back in line. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p206" block_type="txt">But <em>when</em> to bring spending in line with revenue was a source of great disagreement. Some argued for fiscal tightening right away; others argued that this tightening should be postponed until the major economies had recovered from their slump.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p208" block_type="bx3-txt-ni">As you can see from <link href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_12.html">Figure 17-12</link>, the U.S. government paid for World War II by borrowing on a huge scale. By the war&#8217;s end, the public debt was more than 100&#37; of GDP, and many people worried about how it could ever be paid off.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p209" block_type="bx3-txt">The truth is that it never was paid off. In 1946 public debt was &#36;242 billion; that number dipped slightly in the next few years, as the United States ran postwar budget surpluses, but the government budget went back into deficit in 1950 with the start of the Korean War. By 1962 the public debt was back up to &#36;248 billion.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p210" block_type="bx3-txt">But by that time nobody was worried about the fiscal health of the U.S. government because the debt&#8211;GDP ratio had fallen by more than half. The reason? Vigorous economic growth, plus mild inflation, had led to a rapid rise in GDP. The experience was a clear lesson in the peculiar fact that modern governments can run deficits forever, as long as they aren&#8217;t too large.</p>

</box>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p212" block_type="txt-ni">Looking at <link href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_12.html">Figure 17-12</link>, you might be tempted to conclude that until the 2008 crisis struck, the U.S. federal budget was in fairly decent shape: the return to budget deficits after 2001 caused the debt&#8211;GDP ratio to rise a bit, but that ratio was still low compared with both historical experience and some other wealthy countries. In fact, however, experts on long-run budget issues view the situation of the United States (and other countries such as Japan and Italy) with alarm. The reason is the problem of <em>implicit liabilities.</em> <strong>Implicit liabilities</strong> are spending promises made by governments that are effectively a debt despite the fact that they are not included in the usual debt statistics.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p213" block_type="txt">The largest implicit liabilities of the U.S. government arise from two transfer programs that principally benefit older Americans: Social Security and Medicare. The third-largest implicit liability, Medicaid, benefits low-income families. In each of these cases, the government has promised to provide transfer payments to future as well as current beneficiaries. So these programs represent a future debt that must be honored, even though the debt does not currently show up in the usual statistics. Together, these three programs currently account for almost 40&#37; of federal spending.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p214" block_type="txt">The implicit liabilities created by these transfer programs worry fiscal experts. <link href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_13.html">Figure 17-13</link> shows why. It shows actual spending on Social Security and on Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP (a program that provides health care coverage to uninsured children) as percentages of GDP from 2000 to 2013, together with Congressional Budget Office projections of spending through 2038. According to these projections, spending on Social Security will rise substantially over the next few decades and spending on the three health care programs will soar. Why?</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p215" block_type="txt">In the case of Social Security, the answer is demography. Social Security is a &#8220;pay-as-you-go&#8221; system: current workers pay payroll taxes that fund the benefits of current retirees. So the ratio of the number of retirees drawing benefits to the number of workers paying into Social Security has a major impact on the system&#8217;s finances. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p216" block_type="txt">There was a huge surge in the U.S. birth rate between 1946 and 1964, the years of what is commonly called the <em>baby boom.</em> Most baby boomers are currently of working age&#8212;which means they are paying taxes, not collecting benefits. But some are starting to retire, and as more and more of them do so, they will stop earning taxable income and start collecting benefits.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p217" block_type="txt">As a result, the ratio of retirees receiving benefits to workers paying into the Social Security system will rise. In 2010 there were 34 retirees receiving benefits for every 100 workers paying into the system. By 2030, according to the Social Security Administration, that number will rise to 46; by 2050, it will rise to 48; and by 2080, that number will be 51. So as baby boomers move into retirement, benefit payments will continue to rise relative to the size of the economy.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e_ch17_page_498" block_type="page_start">498</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p218" block_type="txt">The aging of the baby boomers, by itself, poses only a moderately sized long-run fiscal problem. The projected rise in Medicare and Medicaid spending is a much more serious concern. The main story behind projections of higher Medicare and Medicaid spending is the long-run tendency of health care spending to rise faster than overall spending, both for government-funded and for privately funded health care.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p219" block_type="txt">To some extent, the implicit liabilities of the U.S. government are already reflected in debt statistics. We mentioned earlier that the government had a total debt of &#36;17 trillion at the end of fiscal 2014 but that only &#36;12 trillion of that total was owed to the public. The main explanation for that discrepancy is that both Social Security and part of Medicare (the hospital insurance program) are supported by <em>dedicated taxes:</em> their expenses are paid out of special taxes on wages. At times, these dedicated taxes yield more revenue than is needed to pay current benefits. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p220" block_type="txt">In particular, since the mid-1980s the Social Security system has been taking in more revenue than it currently needs in order to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers. This surplus in the Social Security system has been used to accumulate a <em>Social Security trust fund,</em> which was &#36;3.0 trillion at the end of fiscal 2014.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p221" block_type="txt">The money in the trust fund is held in the form of U.S. government bonds, which are included in the &#36;17 trillion in total debt. You could say that there&#8217;s something funny about counting bonds in the Social Security trust fund as part of government debt. After all, these bonds are owed by one part of the government (the government outside the Social Security system) to another part of the government (the Social Security system itself). But the debt corresponds to a real, if implicit, liability: promises by the government to pay future retirement benefits. So many economists argue that the gross debt of &#36;17 trillion, the sum of public debt and government debt held by Social Security and other trust funds, is a more accurate indication of the government&#8217;s fiscal health than the smaller amount owed to the public alone.</p>

Meanwhile, the United States was also running large budget deficits and had debt that was high by historical standards. So was America at risk of turning into Greece?</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p225" block_type="bx2-txt">Some influential people thought so, and many dire warnings were issued. For example, in 2010, Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, published an editorial titled &#8220;U.S. Debt and the Greece Analogy,&#8221; in which he warned that the United States could soon face soaring interest rates. In 2011, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, co-chairmen of a presidential commission on the budget, warned that a fiscal crisis was likely within two years. And many others joined the chorus.</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p226" block_type="bx2-txt">In fact, U.S. borrowing costs remained low into 2014, with no hint of a cutoff of lending. But was America just lucky?</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p227" block_type="bx2-txt">Not according to a number of economists, especially the Belgian economist Paul De Grauwe, who began arguing in 2011 that the currency in which a country borrows makes a crucial difference. While the United States has a lot of government debt, it&#8217;s in dollars; similarly, Britain&#8217;s debt is in pounds, and Japan&#8217;s debt is in yen. Greece, Spain, and Portugal, by contrast, no longer have their own currencies; their debts are in euros. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p228" block_type="bx2-txt">Why does this matter? As we&#8217;ve explained previously, even the United States can&#8217;t always rely on printing money to cover its deficits, because doing so can lead to runaway inflation. But the ability to print dollars does mean that the U.S. government can&#8217;t run out of cash. This, in turn, means that we&#8217;re not vulnerable to fiscal panic, in which investors fear a sudden default and, by refusing to lend, cause the very default they fear. And De Grauwe argued that the woes of European debtors were largely driven by the risk of such a fiscal panic. </p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p229" block_type="bx2-txt"><link href="asset/ch17/KrugESS4e_fig_17_14.html">Figure 17-14</link> shows some evidence for De Grauwe&#8217;s view. It compares net debt as a percentage of GDP with interest rates on government bonds for a number of countries in 2012, the worst year of the European debt crisis. The purple markers correspond to countries on the euro&#8212;that is, without their own currencies (the euro area)&#8212;while the green markers show countries with their own currencies. Among the euro nations there was a clear correlation between debt and borrowing costs, but not among the non-euro countries, including the United Kingdom and Japan as well as the United States.</p>

Removing that risk greatly calmed the situation.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p245" block_type="wio-txt-ni">The Congressional Budget Office is an independent federal agency that provides Congress with nonpartisan and timely economic data on budgetary matters. One of its tasks is to produce estimates of GDP and potential GDP and then make projections about recessionary or inflationary gaps. Congress then uses this information to make decisions about the need for expansionary or contractionary fiscal policies. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that actual U.S. GDP was &#36;14.55 trillion and potential GDP was &#36;15.33 trillion for 2008. Knowing this, what was the size of the recessionary gap in 2008? Assuming that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.5, what is the change in government purchases of goods and services necessary to increase GDP by this amount if there are no price changes?</p>
<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p246" block_type="wio-txt">As you have learned, in February 2009 Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that provided for a nominal stimulus of &#36;787 billion. By March 2010, only &#36;62 billion of the nominal stimulus had actually been spent. Based on our assumptions above, by how much would this amount of government spending be expected to increase nominal GDP?</p>

During the last half of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, the recessionary gap began to narrow, but slowly. The gap was still &#36;956 billion at the end of 2011. Stimulus spending in 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 was not enough to quickly and significantly narrow a very wide recessionary gap. </p>

<list id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-list-14" type="ordered" block_type="numbered">
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p255" block_type="sum-nl">The government plays a large role in the economy, collecting a large share of GDP in taxes and spending a large share both to purchase goods and services and to make transfer payments, largely for <strong>social insurance.</strong> <em>Fiscal policy</em> is the use of taxes, government transfers, or government purchases of goods and services to shift the aggregate demand curve.</p></li>
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p256" block_type="sum-nl">Government purchases of goods and services directly affect aggregate demand, and changes in taxes and government transfers affect aggregate demand indirectly by changing households&#8217; disposable income. <strong>Expansionary fiscal policy</strong> shifts the aggregate demand curve rightward; <strong>contractionary fiscal policy</strong> shifts the aggregate demand curve leftward.</p></li>
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p257" block_type="sum-nl">Only when the economy is at full employment is there potential for crowding out of private spending and private investment spending by expansionary fiscal policy. The argument that expansionary fiscal policy won&#8217;t work because of Ricardian equivalence&#8212;that consumers will cut back spending today to offset expected future tax increases&#8212;appears to be untrue in practice. What is clearly true is that very active fiscal policy may make the economy less stable due to time lags in policy formulation and implementation.</p></li>
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p258" block_type="sum-nl">Fiscal policy has a multiplier effect on the economy, the size of which depends on the fiscal policy and the <strong>marginal propensity to consume</strong> (<strong><em>MPC</em></strong>). The <em>MPC</em> determines the size of the <strong>multiplier</strong>, the ratio of the total change in real GDP caused by an <strong>autonomous change in aggregate spending</strong> to the size of that autonomous change. Except in the case of <strong>lump-sum taxes</strong>, taxes reduce the size of the multiplier. Expansionary fiscal policy leads to an increase in real GDP, and contractionary fiscal policy leads to a reduction in real GDP. Because part of any change in taxes or transfers is absorbed by savings in the first round of spending, changes in government purchases of goods and services have a more powerful effect on the economy than equal-sized changes in taxes or transfers. </p></li>
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p259" block_type="sum-nl">Rules governing taxes&#8212;with the exception of lump-sum taxes&#8212;and some transfers act as <strong>automatic stabilizers,</strong> reducing the size of the multiplier and automatically reducing the size of fluctuations in the business cycle. In contrast, <strong>discretionary fiscal policy</strong> arises from deliberate actions by policy makers rather than from the business cycle.</p></li>
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p260" block_type="sum-nl">Some of the fluctuations in the budget balance are due to the effects of the business cycle. In order to separate the effects of the business cycle from the effects of discretionary fiscal policy, governments estimate the <strong>cyclically adjusted budget balance,</strong> an estimate of the budget balance if the economy were at potential output.</p></li>
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p261" block_type="sum-nl">U.S. government budget accounting is calculated on the basis of <strong>fiscal years.</strong> Persistent budget deficits have long-run consequences because they lead to an increase in <strong>public debt.</strong> This can be a problem for two reasons. Public debt may crowd out investment spending, which reduces long-run economic growth. And in extreme cases, rising debt may lead to government default, resulting in economic and financial turmoil.</p></li>
<li><p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p262" block_type="sum-nl">A widely used measure of fiscal health is the <strong>debt&#8211;GDP ratio.</strong> This number can remain stable or fall even in the face of moderate budget deficits if GDP rises over time. However, a stable debt&#8211;GDP ratio may give a misleading impression that all is well because modern governments often have large <strong>implicit liabilities.</strong> The largest implicit liabilities of the U.S. government come from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, the costs of which are increasing due to the aging of the population and rising medical costs.</p></li>

Assume that the aggregate supply curve is horizontal, so that the change in real GDP arising from a shift of the aggregate demand curve equals the size of the shift of the curve. Calculate both the change in government purchases of goods and services and the change in government transfers necessary to close the gap.</p>

<p id="krugmanwellsessentials4e-ch17-p303" block_type="cr-que-nl-mid"><phrase block_type="qnum">7.</phrase> Most macroeconomists believe it is a good thing that taxes act as automatic stabilizers and lower the size of the multiplier. However, a smaller multiplier means that the change in government purchases of goods and services, government transfers, or taxes needed to close an inflationary or recessionary gap is larger. How can you explain this apparent inconsistency?</p>

Two government policy makers disagree as to why this has happened. One argues that a rising budget surplus indicates a growing economy; the other argues that it shows that the government is using contractionary fiscal policy. Can you determine which policy maker is correct? If not, why not?</p>
